1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,920
What should I do
to hide my feelings from him?

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,800
Just tell him.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,840
He seems to like you, too.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,550
Fah, there's something I'd like to tell you.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,840
I'm sorry,

6
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:16,790
I like you, Fah.

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:17,960
Cut!

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,300
By the way, you've actually got
quite great acting skills, Saggy Cheeks.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,990
The way you played the scenes
felt so believable.

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,760
What was on your mind when you were acting?

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,160
Teerak.

12
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,160
May I ask if we can

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,510
do things like how a couple does?

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,480
Is that okay?

15
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,040

17
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,000
I think you should answer the phone first.

18
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,440
I'll be right back, okay?

19
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,210
I apologize for the disturbance, Mr. Muenfah,

20
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,040
but there has been an incident at the bar.

21
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,400
What happened?

22
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,320
Our customer found a bug in their food.

23
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,560
I've informed them that we'll assume
full liability for the cost of the meal.

24
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,760
However, they refused to accept the offer.

25
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,840
They wished to sue us
unless they could speak directly to you, sir.

26
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,520
Mm. Let me speak to them.

27
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,200
Alright, sir. Please hold the line.

28
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,480
Good morning, Fah.

29
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,480
- Uh, about last night...
- I had an amazing sleep last night.

30
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,120
- I...
- Why don't you take a shower first?

31
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,440
Or else you'll be late for breakfast.

32
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,720
Well, I guess I'll shower first.

33
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,440
Babe, can I have a piece of ham?

34
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,920
Sure thing.

35
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,740
What are you guys having?

36
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,480
Stir-fried glass noodles and fried rice.

37
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,110
Whoa, how wonderful.

38
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,100
- Oh.
- Hey, come and sit here.

39
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,960
Hey! That was mine!

40
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,920
Nom...

41
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,640
What's with you?

42
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,200
Did you drop this piece?

43
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,800
You're being pessimistic again.

44
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,440
- Dom.
- Hm?

45
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,680
Did he drop this on the floor?

46
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,840
Nope. Maybe you're just overthinking.

47
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,440
I've got a mouth ulcer; you can have it instead.

48
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,720
- How sweet.
- Type.

49
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,320
How is it? Is it sweet?

50
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
Yes.

51
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,030
Type, is it sweet?

52
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,680
I think it is.

53
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,080
Sheesh.

54
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,320
Do you want to have this, then?

55
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,560
Have this one.

56
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Which one?

57
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,440
- I think something's up.
- Hey...

58
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,910
- Hm?
- Something's wrong.

59
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,560
Something's off, right?

60
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,800
Hey, do you think it's weird?

61
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,290
What's weird?

62
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,160
Look. They're sitting so far apart from each other.

63
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,680
Yeah, it is weird.

64
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,910
- Did you have a good sleep last night?
- Yes.

65
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,400
You look tired, though.

66
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,110
- You're not sick, right?
- No.

67
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,120
Check out our rating on the app.

68
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,080
We've been review bombed.

69
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,159
Mm.

70
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,560
I think we need to take extra measures
about our food.

71
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,570
Mm.

72
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,880
Please look into hiring a QC for the place.

73
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,560
Yes, Mr. Muenfah.

74
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,260
Feel free to report to us about anything.

75
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,200
About us getting sued,

76
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,440
- I'll deal with it myself.
- Yes, sir.

77
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,400
So they are actually suing us?

78
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,800
Mm.

79
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,680
I've heard that they are going to.

80
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,300
Still, I haven't received any documents.

81
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,800
I'm also thinking that

82
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,940
the fact that incidents
keep occurring at our place

83
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,760
might not have been just a coincidence.

84
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,280
Yeah, I think so.

85
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,120
I'll take care of my part.

86
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,679
Sure thing.

87
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,220
Okay. Just tell me if you need a hand.

88
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,260
I'm heading downstairs.

89
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,640
- Are you coming with me?
- I'll be there later.

90
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,679
Okay.

91
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,120
See you.

92
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,860
["That's much better than phone calls, and..."]

93
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,240
["Let's say that I'm not available for calls"]

94
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,200
["But you do it, too"]

95
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,560
["Eh!?"]

96
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,130
["I get it; I'm not going to call you"]

97
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,120
["But don't ask me to stop calling you, okay?
I miss you a lot"]

98
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,040
["Why does this feel so good?"]

99
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,880
[Muenfah: Have you gone to bed?]

100
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,080
[Muenfah: Have you gone to bed?]

101
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,320
Did you finish reading it? Was it fun?

102
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,830
Mm.

103
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,760
What's wrong? Why are you making that face?

104
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,760
Babe,

105
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,160
can I ask you a question?

106
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,880
Mm.

107
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:30,220
At first, how did you realize

108
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,880
you were falling in love with Dom?

109
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,260
Well...

110
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,390
I wasn't sure at first.

111
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,320
However, after thinking about it for a while,

112
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,720
I guess it's something simple;

113
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,400
for example,

114
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,760
the way he made me laugh very easily.

115
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,240
Never thought I'd get
to see this side of yours.

116
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,490
Or it was the way
he stayed with me when I was stressed.

117
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,360
If anything else worries you,

118
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,600
just let me know.

119
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,260
Sometimes...

120
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,360
It was the way he helped me
become the better version of myself.

121
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,940
I've embraced what you taught me:

122
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,880
forgiving others, forgiving myself,

123
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,200
and becoming stronger.

124
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,300
Teerak, come closer.

125
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,360
You're asking me this because of Fah, right?

126
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,960
I knew it.

127
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,600
I've noticed it since we were at the beach.

128
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,320
Right?

129
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:02,940
Well...

130
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,480
Yes.

131
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,340
So...

132
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,710
I am

133
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,640
a bit confused.

134
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,230
No need to overthink it.

135
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,770
Feel free to open up to me.

136
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,040
So...

137
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:30,070
I don't know what I'm currently feeling.

138
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,120
Rak, sometimes, it's nothing complicated.

139
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,640
Don't make it seem that way.

140
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,760
Just say whatever you're feeling.

141
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,000
Sometimes, things you're worrying about
in your mind

142
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,080
might not be like what you thought.

143
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,120
Teerak.

144
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,720
Simply do what your heart says.

145
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,080
I'm the one supporting you.

146
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,200
It's not just pretending
to be a couple anymore, is it?

147
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,120
Babe!

148
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,360
Huh?

149
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,240
May I go to see Fah right now?

150
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,560
What's wrong?

151
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,120
Pretty lit, right?

152
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,120
Of course,

153
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,840
we're the queens.

154
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,440
The guys here are so handsome.

155
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,600
- Absolutely.
- Are they your type?

156
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:56,130
Yeah, you can't blame me. I look stellar tonight.

157
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,640
Staff.

158
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,300
Hey, waiter.

159
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,790
Right?

160
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,360
Where the hell are they?

161
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,790
Well, of course!

162
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,830
Hey, there are no staff around at all?

163
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,600
- Oh!
- Whoa...

164
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:12,800
Sorry.

165
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,640
- I'm looking for staff. Sorry.
- So pretty, girl.

166
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,520
I think he likes you.

167
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,280
Where are the staff, damn it?

168
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,500
Staff!

169
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,560
- See?
- Lucky you.

170
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,920
I want to refill my glass!

171
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,920
- Sorry, I'm a bit tipsy.
- Right, right.

172
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,120
Guys, I think this is getting weird.

173
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,220
Staff!

174
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,460
Hey, what's with you?!

175
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,920
Shut up, you trans.

176
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,360
- Huh?!
- Huh?

177
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,210
Girls, stop.

178
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,720
Sit down. I'll deal with him.

179
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,040
I'm trans; so what?

180
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,500
Why? Is there a sign at the front
that says this is a men's-only bar?

181
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,360
I'm trans, but I pay the bills.

182
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,560
Do you think I'm here for a free drink?

183
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,200
Stop!

184
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,720
Do you think that you can win?

185
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,520
I'm gonna roast you until you're a better man.

186
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,360
My words are more sacred than your mom's!

187
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,640
Come here.

188
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,220
Thank you.

189
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,010
Mister! Mister!

190
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,050
A round of applause!

191
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,010
10 out of 10.

192
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,140
Customers...

193
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,800
Customers,

194
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,520
please calm down.

195
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,320
Both of you, please leave this place.

196
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,240
Who are you?

197
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,960
I'm the manager.

198
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,240
I don't talk to the likes of you.

199
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,840
Where's the owner?

200
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,180
Bar owner?

201
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,440
It's me.

202
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,680
What happened?

203
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,200
How will you take responsibility for this?

204
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,160
That stupid trans insulted me.

205
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,560
I've never gotten mad when you called me trans

206
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,960
because that's who I am.

207
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,880
You called me "stupid," right?

208
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,480
Do I look that brainless like your mom?!

209
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,130
Please! Calm down.

210
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,640
I'd like both of you to settle this in my office.

211
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,310
Let go!

212
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,140
Let me go!

213
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,340
I'm not up for a talk.

214
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,560
I'll make this bastard bow before my feet,
right in front of everyone's eyes!

215
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,560
- You want me to bow before you?
- Yeah!

216
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,240
Right!

217
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,440
Hey!

218
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,110
Leave this place now.

219
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,300
I'm leaving.

220
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,040
But not without some bloodshed!

221
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,510
- Come, then!
- Let's go!

222
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,320
Stop. I don't hurt women.

223
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,840
Get him! Get him!

224
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,600
What is it?

225
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,400
A fight broke out in the bar, Mr. Muenfah.

226
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,640
- Get him!
- Calm down!

227
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,440
- Get him!
- Please calm down!

228
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,000
Grab him!

229
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,440
- Stop! Stop!
- Get him!

230
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,010
- Stop it!
- Get him!

231
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:49,760
Hey!

232
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,600
Get him!

233
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,640
Grab him!

234
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,300
- Get him, guys!
- Get him!

235
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,440
Get him!

236
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,000
Stop!

237
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,120
Are you guys alright?

238
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,079
Calm down.

239
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm sorry on my end
for the negative experience you have had.

240
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,920
However, if you're not going to respect our staff,

241
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,640
then we'd like to do the same.

242
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,250
I'd like all of you to immediately leave this bar

243
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,600
and pay for any damages you've caused.

244
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,280
I'm not paying.

245
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,280
I'm also going to tell everyone

246
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,000
how your staff treated me.

247
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,560
Settle everything, get all the charges,

248
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,960
and send bills to these two customers.

249
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,830
They can choose to either pay up

250
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,840
or go to jail.

251
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,550
Guys, let's go.

252
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,380
Go.

253
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,600
This way, please.

254
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,970
I'm going to make them pay.

255
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,280
Now that this has happened,

256
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,660
I'm now confident.

257
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,960
About what?

258
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,600
What do we have here?

259
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,920
I could hear loud noises from even outside.

260
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,920
The indoor area is closed right now.

261
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,480
Only the outdoor area is available.

262
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,730
I'm just worried about you guys.

263
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,300
You guys are looking very stressed.

264
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,680
It'll be alright, okay?

265
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,800
You're behind this, right?

266
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,720
Don't just randomly accuse me.

267
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,760
I can sue you guys.

268
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:37,280
You'd be better off saving your funds
and taking care of the place.

269
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,480
Hey.

270
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,360
Easy.

271
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,620
I think he didn't just make a random accusation.

272
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,640
These two men were the culprits
behind the previous incident at the bar.

273
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,570
No matter how much they paid you,

274
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:56,720
I'll make it double.

275
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,360
What are you on about?

276
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,120
Why did you call us here?

277
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,200
I already know everything about you,

278
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,480
including the one hiring you.

279
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,960
You're wrong, boy.

280
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,720
- Nobody actually hired us.
- If you refuse to agree to my terms,

281
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,760
we'll settle this at the police station.

282
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,080
Guards!

283
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,020
The reason I didn't call the police

284
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,840
isn't that I don't know about it,

285
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,840
but it is that I want to see your face

286
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,840
when you realize
you are being outsmarted by me.

287
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,430
It amuses me.

288
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,660
Bastard!

289
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,200
Fah!

290
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,010
Fah!

291
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,140
Damn it! Let go!

292
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,480
Fah!

293
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,480
That's enough.

294
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,620
Let go!

295
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,600
Teerak...

296
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,520
- Oh!
- Oh.

297
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,720
Oh!

298
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,960
Oh! Oh!

299
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,360
- Let me go!
- You're staying right here!

300
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:02,960
Oh!

301
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,790
Let me go!

302
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,440
Oh!

303
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,280
Oh!

304
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,150
- Let go!
- Oh!

305
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,560
Fah, that's enough!

306
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,920
Goddammit!

307
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,800
Let go of me!

308
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,320
Teerak, are you hurt?

309
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,600
This isn't over.

310
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,840
If it isn't, then come get us.

311
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,270
Come!

312
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,320
If you're not done, it's fine.

313
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,760
But you have to talk to your mom
about your future.

314
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,280
Bring it.

315
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,100
I'll take my leave now.

316
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,600
Let me drive you home.

317
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,920
It's fine.

318
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,250
I'm just worried about you guys.

319
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,780
You guys are looking very stressed.

320
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,140
It'll be alright, okay?

321
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,800
You're behind this, right?

322
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,280
Don't just randomly accuse me.

323
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,440
I can sue you guys.

324
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,960
All this mess

325
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,920
was because of you.

326
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,320
Do you know how much you've ruined my reputation?

327
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,880
I've already told you to do nothing.

328
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,360
Do absolutely nothing.

329
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
And what's this?

330
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,760
I didn't do anything to Muenfah, Mom.

331
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,080
- With that video, I...
- I demand you to stop.

332
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,480
Stop messing with Muenfah

333
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,600
and that boy named Teerak

334
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,880
so that things would die down.

335
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,230
- But...
- No more "buts," Oh.

336
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,230
No more of that.

337
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,520
If you're still going to double down,

338
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,560
we're both doomed.

339
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,510
It's not just about the reputation.

340
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,860
You and I might get dragged into the court.

341
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,600
Don't make me feel even more ashamed.

342
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,160
Do you ever care
about anything else aside from your image?

343
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,920
I'm this hurt

344
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,630
and this wounded,

345
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,240
but you've never asked me about it.

346
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,630
Okay.

347
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,830
It's my fault.

348
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,440
You're not in the wrong,

349
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,760
and you never will be.

350
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,600
I love you, Mom,

351
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,320
but I never feel like you love me.

352
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:56,430
Just so you know, I'm this way

353
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,970
because of you.

354
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,440
"All this mess

355
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,880
was because of you."

356
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,710
"Do you know how much you've ruined my reputation?"

357
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,920
"Don't make me feel even more ashamed."

358
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,760
"All this mess

359
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,080
was because of you."

360
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,960
"Don't make me feel even more ashamed."

361
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,450
"Do you know how much you've ruined my reputation?"

362
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:57,960
"All this mess

363
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,040
was because of you."

364
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,540
Teerak.

365
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,500
Are you alright, Oh?

366
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,240
Teerak...

367
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,120
I'm sorry.

368
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,580
About last night,

369
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,440
I'm sorry.

370
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,310
It's okay. I'm not mad at you.

371
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,880
I knew that you wouldn't.

372
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,600
- You have to...
- It's true that I'm not...

373
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,020
But now that we're here,

374
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,120
I'm sorry about everything that has happened.

375
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,080
Thank you for having feelings for me,

376
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,120
but may I ask you one thing?

377
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,040
From now on...

378
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,480
May I ask you to stop messing with me?

379
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,290
Why do you love someone like Fah,

380
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,750
despite his hot temper,

381
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,120
bad manners,

382
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,760
and the fact that he almost beat me to death?

383
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,720
Despite all that, you still love him?

384
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,490
Yes.

385
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,320
There are no reasons for me to hate him.

386
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,480
Despite his hot temper

387
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,040
and bad manners,

388
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,360
I still love him.

389
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,240
You actually love him that much?

390
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,480
Yes.

391
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,000
Now, I know that

392
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,360
I love him very much.

393
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,560
I'd like you

394
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:57,110
to forgive me

395
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,710
for the decision I've made.

396
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,440
This means that

397
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,280
you never love me?

398
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,200
You never do, right?

399
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,290
Yes.

400
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,040
I never love you, Oh.

401
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,280
Urgh!

402
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,080
Are you alright?

403
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,720
Are you hurt?

404
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,720
I'm fine.

405
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,850
What about you?

406
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,360
Oh, I'm alright.
["Saggy Cheeks"]

407
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:44,050
It's good to see that you're fine.

408
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,400
Next time, please be careful when crossing a road.

409
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,040
Whoa...

410
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,760
You sure you're alright?

411
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,360
You're bleeding everywhere.

412
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,500
Use my handkerchief to stop it from

413
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,040
bleeding for now.

414
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,060
I will...

415
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,280
take you to the nurse's office.

416
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,640
Okay.

417
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,680
Right.

418
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,040
Please use this handkerchief.

419
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,600
Someone told me not to be sad all alone.

420
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,180
You can share your sorrow with me.

421
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,370
It's great that you directly confront Oh.

422
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,370
It's to the point.

423
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,449
Mm. At least I spoke my mind to him.

424
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,400
You've done a great job.

425
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,739
Yes, it's the new Saggy Cheeks.

426
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,320
I'm so, so proud of you.

427
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:49,550
I'd been thinking about
what could make you seriously say no to Oh,

428
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,920
but now I know.

429
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:53,620
It's because of Muenfah
that you've changed this much.

430
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,739
Ah!

431
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,719
"Love makes us grow."

432
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,320
That's really touching

433
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,520
and fulfilling.

434
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:04,960
What's wrong?

435
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,960
Aren't you stressed out because of Oh?

436
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,290
So...

437
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,860
I have something important to tell you

438
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,520
and consult with you about.

439
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,000
Is it about wedding invitation cards?

440
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,400
Woo!

441
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,840
At the start, Fah and I

442
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,680
were not really a couple.

443
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,480
We were just pretending that we were.

444
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,800
- You lied to me, Saggy Cheeks?
- You lied to me, Saggy Cheeks?

445
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:40,040
I'm sorry.

446
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,720
Lee, you already knew it, right?

447
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,200
Then why didn't you tell me?

448
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,160
I thought you two wouldn't believe me.

449
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,560
- Why did you lie?
- Yeah.

450
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,880
I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.

451
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,040
I'm heading home.

452
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,520
Hey, look at his face.
He's about to cry.

453
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,600
Please don't be mad at him.

454
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,680
He had reasons behind it.

455
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,920
You guys do know what he's like.

456
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,680
I'm sorry, Joy.

457
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,920
Here, you can slap my hand for that.

458
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,070
Why are you telling us just now?

459
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,200
Well...

460
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,470
I'm done hiding the truth,

461
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,400
and I have something to consult with you about.

462
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,560
What can it be?

463
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,360
You're already done with Oh.

464
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,400
So you and Muenfah
can just stop playing the game, right?

465
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Are you actually having feelings for my brother?

466
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,240
Huh?

467
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,640
Mm.

468
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,040
Aww, don't cry.

469
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,370
Here, have my brownies.

470
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,720
Nom.

471
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,840
You're crying,
but you're still enjoying food.

472
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,090
Why are you teasing him?

473
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,600
You know that he's crying.

474
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,290
To compensate for those times
you were a couple...

475
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,600
We left you to fly solo back then, right?

476
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,240
From now on, Joy and I

477
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,950
are going to support you.

478
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,160
How's that?

479
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,480
Don't be nervous.

480
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,440
With my brother, just tell him straight up.

481
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,040
I don't know what he's thinking of me, though.

482
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,460
I can't bring myself to say anything
when I see his face.

483
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,680
Why?

484
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,720
You're worried that you'd get rejected?

485
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,920
What if he doesn't have feelings for me?

486
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,360
Aww, it's okay.

487
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:27,320
Fah, Dad had an accident.
He's urgently being admitted to the hospital.

488
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,480
Where are you right now?

489
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,880
Can you and your brother
fly to Hong Kong to check on him?

490
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,990
I'm booking an urgent flight.

491
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,560
How's Dad?

492
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,000
I... I have no clue, Fah.

493
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,280
Please hang in there, Mom.

494
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,480
Fah?

495
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,330
Quiet, guys. Fah's calling me.

496
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,290
Hello, Fah?

497
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:56,250
Lee, Dad got into an accident;

498
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,120
we have to fly to Hong Kong immediately.

499
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,920
Right, Fah.

500
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,600
I'm heading out right now.

501
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,200
See you at the airport.

502
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,180
My family is having an issue.

503
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,680
I have to take an urgent flight to
Hong Kong to see them.

504
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,840
- What happened?
- My dad had an accident.

505
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,600
- Make haste, Lee.
- Tell Professor that I have to take my leave.

506
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,640
Yeah, yeah.

507
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,920
It must be a very big deal.

508
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,040
Of course, I guess.

509
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,180
Or else Muenfah wouldn't have called him.

510
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,160
We should go to our class
so that we can inform our Professor.

511
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,160
You guys can go to the class first.
I'll join you later.

512
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,080
- Huh?
- Where are you going?

513
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,560
Uh... To the airport.

514
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,400
Huh?

515
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,040
- Hey!
- Don't.

516
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,600
Let him go.

517
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,520
- We should head to the class and...
- My backpack.

518
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,210
Fah.

519
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,870
- Let's check in.
- Let's go.

520
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,080
Thank you.

521
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,440
Thank you.

522
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,880
Hello? What's up, Saggy Cheeks?

523
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,200
Lee, where are you?

524
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,180
I'm on my way to the gate.

525
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,360
What's up? Need something?

526
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,000
Well, I...

527
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,040
Nothing.

528
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,560
- Have a safe flight.
- Right. Thank you.

529
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,600
Catch you later.

530
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:16,640
[Joy: How did it go?]

531
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:29,600
[Teerak: I was too late, but don't tell Lee]

532
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,880
Oh, honey...

533
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,400
Why did you bother our kids to fly here?

534
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,520
I'm perfectly fine.

535
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,770
Sweetheart.

536
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,760
You fell over that hard,

537
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,800
why wouldn't I get worried?

538
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,120
It's fine.

539
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,280
We're here because we're worried about you.

540
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,080
- Mm.
- Hey...

541
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,950
Let me tell you that I'm perfectly fine.

542
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:05,520
This only takes 2-3 days to heal.

543
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,850
Aww, 2-3 days?

544
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:09,520
Just look at this.

545
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,760
When Fah called me, I was still at the university.

546
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,980
I was horribly shocked.

547
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,840
Did you miss your class?

548
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,240
I did.

549
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,170
It's fine because my friends,

550
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,600
Teerak, Type, and Joy
will cover the assignment for me.

551
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,270
Please take a good rest.

552
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,200
I'll deal with your business at the hotel.

553
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,240
I don't want to drop my work.

554
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:39,210
Honey, a VIP guest is coming
to the hotel tomorrow.

555
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:43,400
He's our company's business partner,
and he's there for a meeting with me.

556
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,000
I'll handle it for you.

557
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,040
I'll be there, too.
Don't you worry, Mom.

558
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,360
Really?

559
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,210
What a relief.

560
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:56,960
Fah.

561
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,360
I'll leave this to you.

562
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,120
Right.

563
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,150
Does it still hurt?

564
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,760
Take a good rest.

565
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,640
You're always worried about your work.

566
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:21,040
Okay, so, this is all of our plan

567
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,880
and our agreement, which is for your assets.

568
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,080
Do you guys have any questions,
or do you have any complaints?

569
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,400
You can tell me right now.

570
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,440
Please read the contract first
before you sign it.

571
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,840
- Okay. Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

572
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,520
Pleasure doing business with you.

573
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,200
Thank you very much for your time.

574
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,400
Thank you.

575
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,960
- Thank you.
- Okay.

576
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,120
Thank you.

577
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:51,960
Thank you.

578
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,400
For the reception,

579
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,720
I'd like you to handle
escorting our clients from the airport.

580
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,080
Of course, Mr. Muenfah.

581
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,660
You two brothers have done such a fine job.

582
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,640
If your Dad knows this,
he'd definitely be overjoyed.

583
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,140
I barely did a thing.

584
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,080
The credit goes to him.

585
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,660
My brother is the best.

586
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,460
Let's go. You guys must be exhausted.

587
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,680
You can go and have a rest now.

588
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,960
Take care of him, okay?

589
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,040
I'll escort you.

590
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,120
It's okay, take him on a break.

591
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,680
Right.

592
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,240
[Teerak: Lee, how are you guys?]

593
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,280
[Type: Yeah, how are things?]

594
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,760
[Joy: Yeah, you've gone completely silent]

595
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,160
[Lee: My Dad is okay now]

596
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,440
[Teerak: What about Fah?]

597
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,160
Fah.

598
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:04,960
Fah...

599
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:07,440
Fah!

600
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,460
What are you doing? You look stressed.

601
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,080
Within a few days,
we must host the party for the client.

602
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,940
I need to manage it, too.

603
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,160
Will Dad recover in time?

604
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,640
I think he will.

605
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,200
Why did you call me, though?

606
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,000
I saw you looking a bit stressed out.

607
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,920
I was wondering if it was about Rak.

608
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,600
Yes, I'm stressed out about that, too.

609
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,550
Why are you stressed out about him?

610
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:35,840
You can consult me if you'd like.

611
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,720
I'm worried that he wouldn't like me.

612
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:44,960
What?

613
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,560
I'm worried that he'd no longer love me.

614
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,960
What? Don't tell me that you also love him.

615
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,200
I mean...

616
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,360
Why...

617
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,800
What makes you think that way?

618
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,360
He saw me snap when I was beating up Oh.

619
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,840
I think he's now afraid of me.

620
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:49,600
[Group: Naughty Gang (4)
Teerak: What about Fah? How is he? (Read 2)]

621
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,320
Here's some fruit.

622
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,040
Rak.

623
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,120
Has your study been hard, dear?

624
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,800
You seem so stressed.

625
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,440
Do I, Mom?

626
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,120
Yes, you look very stressed out.

627
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:21,560
Hm?

628
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,440
Agreed.

629
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,490
You seem to lose your appetite.

630
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,600
This isn't Teerak your Grandpa knows.

631
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,920
See? Your cheeks are all gone.

632
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,200
Rak.

633
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,720
No matter what issues you're facing,

634
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,080
please take your time, okay?

635
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:44,610
I believe that
there's a solution to every problem.

636
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:47,270
If you'd like to consult me on anything,

637
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,720
I'm always here,

638
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:50,340
okay?

639
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,400
I'm here for you, too.

640
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,330
- Okay?
- Yes.

641
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,760
Here.

642
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,770
Have a bite first.

643
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,520
Eat a lot of food, okay?

644
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:06,450
Okay?

645
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,360
- Don't forget that.
- Right.

646
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:11,880
Don't be stressed out.

647
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,000
No need to worry,

648
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,430
- okay?
- Right.

649
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:27,220
Fortunately, Mr. Ratchapong was not very hard.

650
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,240
Yeah, but you know what?

651
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:33,820
Lucky me, because my sons,
both of them, helped me out a lot,

652
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,800
so our project went smoothly.

653
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,400
Good evening.

654
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:03,880
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

655
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:07,780
You're very talented, Mr. Muenfah.

656
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,360
Thank you very much.

657
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,720
Our project wouldn't be possible
without the help of my Dad and our team.

658
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,080
This project is in collaboration with my Dad.

659
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:19,200
Yes, we're very thankful for you guys to be here.

Thank you.

Let me help you.

664
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:28,600
Okay, quickly.

665
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,400
Whoa...

666
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:32,960
That's great.

A little boy who once snuck
into Dad's office to play

668

We're so proud of you, dear.

670

This really puts my mind at ease.

671
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,900
Our family business will remain thriving.

672
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,120
I'm also proud of you, Lee.

673
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,430
I love you very much.

674
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:02,930
Don't be upset, alright?

675
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:07,340
This problem had been haunting me
for months before it was resolved.

676
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:11,200
I guess I now have to share
the piece of the pie with you, Muenfah,

677
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,170
the owner of Your Sky,

678
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,800
and you as well, Punlee.

679
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,400
Let me have some too, okay?

680
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:21,520
Sure thing, Mom.

681
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:25,810
Oh, who's in charge of the bar now
that you're here?

682
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,480
I have Real taking care of it.

683
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,640
Oh, if that's the case,

684
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:34,240
we have to bring treats to your friends, too.

685
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,360
Also, on that note,

686
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,000
when we're back in Thailand,
shall we go on a trip, honey?

687
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:40,760
- Shall we?
- Of course, sweetheart.

688
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:41,820
That's a good idea.

689
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,760
If you're going to travel to Thailand,

690
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,200
I'll be your guide.

691
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,320
By the way, how are things, dear?

692
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,400
It's going alright.

693
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,120
I've got no financial issues.

694
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,360
But his love is a different story.

695
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:58,710
Love?

696
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,480
- Huh?
- Huh?!

697
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:01,480
Hold on...

698
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,080
Who did you fall in love with?

699
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:06,860
- Why did you leave us in the dark, huh?
- Mm!

700
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,600
I have a crush on a junior.

701
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,560
His name is Teerak.

702
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,360
- Teerak?
- Teerak?

703
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:16,960
Really?

704
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:23,120
You're beaming,
which means you love him very much, right?

705
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,000
Whoa!

706
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,280
Please?

707
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,840
Give me a kiss on the head.

708
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,870
I want him to be happy every single day.

709
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:48,040
- That's because...
- You can do it, Fah! Keep going!

710
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,040
He makes me forget that

711
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,040
I'm afraid of falling in love.

712
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:58,520
He's a ray of sunshine in my life.

713
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,400
Since you love him that much,

714
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,320
are you two dating?

715
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,260
I haven't officially asked him.

716
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,670
I'm afraid that

717
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:44,040
he won't like me.

718
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:45,680
Aw...

719
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,440
I have my bad sides,

720
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,400
which I haven't fixed.

721
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,360
To love someone,

722
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:58,280
I want to be as perfect as I can be

723
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,760
before being their life partner.

724
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,080
Listen.

725
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,560
If you're waiting for that day to come,

726
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,760
when will that happen?

727
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:12,160
If you don't risk it, then you won't know it.

728
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:16,500
In the end, it might've been you
who was filled with regrets

729
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:20,120
for being too afraid to do anything.

730
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,520
Fah.

731
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,520
Although we're not perfect,

732
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,480
we're deserving of being loved.

733
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,150
Mm. Don't assume the worst yourself.

734
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,320
I'm still worried about you.

735
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,480
The last time you were heartbroken
by your ex-partner,

736
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,680
my heart shattered into pieces.

737
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,080
I'm very confident with this love.

738
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,890
I'm also going to make it better.

739
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:52,800
First and foremost,

740
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,120
you have to tell him first.

741
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,040
At this rate, Saggy Cheeks
is worrying about you to death.

742
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:58,940
Be confident, Bro.

743
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:02,720
Okay?

744
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:10,200
I'm so excited to see who he is.

745
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,840
If you guys have a chance to meet him,

746
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,280
I think you'll definitely love him.

747
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,360
Well, bring him over.

748
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,050
You'll do it, right?

749
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:55,600
Teerak, when I'm back in Thailand, let's...

750
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,070
Hello, Saggy Cheeks.

751
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,000
- How are you?
- Fah told me that

752
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,080
he had an important thing to discuss with me.

753
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:04,080
Babe, Fah and I...

754
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,320
I don't know when it happened...

755
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,880
However, I haven't told my parents
and my grandpa.

756
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,600
I don't know what they'd think of this.

757
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,560
I get it. Don't overthink it, okay?

758
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,760
I'm always here, waiting for you.
