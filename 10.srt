1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:01,960
Fah,

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,290
this is Mookrob, our new family member.

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,200
Hey, Fah, is Rak with you?

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,880
Yeah, he's sleeping.

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,920
I'll take him home when he wakes up.

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,560
I actually called to tell him that
he could stay at your place.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,200
However, you just made us realize that

8
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,760
our older son has been living his happiest life.

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,160
I think I'm the luckiest person in this world.

10
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,120
You have a tattoo?

11
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,160
What does it mean?

12
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,480
It's us.

13
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,960
The sky and the sea

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,600
that finally meet.

15
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,560
Morning.

16
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,240
I was...

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,320
gonna ask...

18
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,800
if you were okay.

19
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,560
I totally am.

20
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,759

22
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,480
Thank you for giving me a ride.

23
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,720
I almost forgot.

24
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,760
Are you free tomorrow evening?

25
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,560
I am.

26
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,960
Is there anything?

27
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,070
I have to discuss business matters
during that time,

28
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,680
and I'd like you to join us.

29
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,920
My mom wants you to be there.

30
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,840
Sure, I also wanna meet her.

31
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,570
My parents really adore you.

32
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,440
Soon...

33
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,880
they'll probably give you everything.

34
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,680
Everyone in your family is so sweet to me

35
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,330
besides Lee!

36
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,480
I'll see you tomorrow.

37
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,279
Call me if you can't sleep.

38
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,560
Uh...

39
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,720
Drive safely, okay?

40
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,600
- You're back?
- Yes.

41
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,000
You look so happy. Something good happened?

42
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,640
Uh...

43
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,960
It's just that...

44
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,200
I'll get to eat your desserts!

45
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,760
Hang on!

46
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,120
You can't eat these. They're for my client.

47
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,040
You have lots of orders today?

48
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,160
Why did you make so many of them?

49
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,800
I've got one client,

50
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,510
but they're gonna use my desserts

51
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,130
for their wedding procession.

52
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,080
Don't you think they look good?

53
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,310
They look beautiful.

54
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,760
Of course they do; I made them.

55
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,500
On your wedding day,

56
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,310
you need to use my desserts

57
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,680
for your procession.
They're gonna be amazing.

58
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,920
Mom...

59
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,680
Yes?

60
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,800
Have you ever pictured
what my lover might be like?

61
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,920
I actually have.

62
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:38,440
I think that person
is going to be polished and proper,

63
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,320
and she must be very sweet.

64
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,390
I'm okay with who you'll choose, though.

65
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,040
It's your decision.

66
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,040
Well...

67
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,320
What matters to me is if they can make you happy.

68
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,960
Thanks, Mom.

69
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,080
For what?

70
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,160
Uh... Nothing.

71
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,280
Nothing?

72
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,840
Come in.

73
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,680
Babe, can I use your hair dryer?

74
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,760
Mine's broken.

75
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,600
Sure, I just finished using it.

76
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,800
- You want me to do it for you?
- Yep.

77
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,120
Fine.

78
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Hey!

79
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,240
Mookrob, stay still!

80
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,680
Come on, I'm not Mookrob!

81
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,000
How can you not be?
Look how naughty you are.

82
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,680
Aw, just kidding.

83
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,120
Hey, come up here.

84
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,400
I forgot to ask you this.

85
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,520
How did it go meeting Muenfah's parents?

86
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,600
I was really anxious and worried at first,

87
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:36,960
but they were really kind and sweet to me,

88
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,240
even though it was the first time we met.

89
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,760
And that made me...

90
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,840
want to introduce him to our family.

91
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,240
I don't want to keep it
from our parents and grandpa.

92
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,090
I get it.

93
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,840
When I thought about
introducing Dom to our family,

94
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,560
I was worried, too.

95
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,120
I didn't know what to do,

96
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,480
but I did it.

97
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,560
Don't worry, okay?

98
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,880
I'll help you.

99
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,470
Thanks, Babe.

100
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,800
Aww.

101
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,040
Your hair dryer isn't broken, is it?

102
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,680
You wanted me to cheer you up, right?

103
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,600
You can talk to me, you know that?

104
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,800
You're my only brother,

105
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,039
got it?

106
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,440
Yes, Babe.

107
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,159
Though I've said this countless times,

108
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,000
I wanna tell you that...

109
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,400
I love you the most!

110
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,880
Ghlai,

111
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,440
come sit with me.

112
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,080
Thanks.

113
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,000
You're here to study?

114
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,750
Yeah, I have an upcoming quiz.

115
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,680
You're studying hard.

116
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,680
What are you doing here?

117
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,000
You have a quiz, too?

118
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,320
You look worried.

119
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,720
No, it's just that I'm running out of ideas.

120
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,190
Ideas for what, if I may ask?

121
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,680
I have an assignment
to design a character,

122
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,440
whether it's animate or inanimate,

123
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,000
and submit it to the professor

124
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,840
for the exhibition display.

125
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,160
The problem is that
I still can't think of anything.

126
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,480
What do you want to design?

127
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,960
I have no idea.

128
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,920
I've been thinking for an hour,

129
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,560
and I got nothing.

130
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,760
Well...

131
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,390
What about designing something you like?

132
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,840
Something I like?

133
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,200
Yes.

134
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,560
When it's something you like,

135
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,960
it'll be easier to come up with ideas.

136
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,640
Something I like?

137
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
What kind of thing?

138
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,170
Um...

139
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,320
You have a sense of fashion.

140
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,080
Based on that,

141
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,880
I think you'd be good at fashion design.

142
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,190
It's just my idea.

143
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,360
Graphic shirts, tote bags,

144
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,240
and caps

145
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,720
suit you really well.

146
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,720
You're right,

147
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,280
but wouldn't that be too simple?

148
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,720
If you're the designer,

149
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,440
it's gonna be so you and very unique.

150
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,040
It's not gonna be simple.

151
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,000
Though it is,

152
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,160
it's gonna be simple yet extraordinary.

153
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,920
Thanks.

154
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,600
What's wrong with the Wi-Fi?

155
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,600
- The Internet is down?
- Connect to this one.

156
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,200
Wait, why are you here alone? Where's Real?

157
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,830
Why would he be with me?

158
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,840
You two are usually inseparable.
Babe and I can't even beat that.

159
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,280
How come? You two are still fighting?

160
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,200
I accidentally said something rude to him.

161
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,760
And what's the problem? Make it up to him.

162
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,400
Make it up to him?

163
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,030
I don't think he wants to see me ever again.

164
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,640
He's completely gone.

165
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,840
How can you be sure?

166
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,520
He might be waiting for you.

167
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,840
Waiting for what?
I don't know how to make it up to him.

168
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,240
Well...

169
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,880
Is he not coming to class?

170
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,120
I don't know.

171
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,680
He's usually not late.

172
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,040
I don't think he's coming.

173
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,760
The exhibition showcasing your projects
is just weeks away.

174
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,360
Feel free to reach out

175
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,480
if you have any questions.

176
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,560
I'm rooting for you guys.

177
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,720
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

178
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,720
Thank you.

179
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,400
What are you making for the art market?

180
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,640
Well, mine's an art toy,

181
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,760
but I haven't finished it yet.

182
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,160
My project...

183
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,000
is as lovely as I am.

184
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,220
You know, lovely hair clips

185
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,060
or handmade keychains.

186
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,680
Are those lovely?

187
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,360
What's your project?

188
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,880
I'm making a board game.

189
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,060
An actual one?

190
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,600
- That's cool.
- Obviously.

191
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,800
It's not finished yet.

192
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,680
It's just so detailed.

193
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,800
I'll get back to it after class.

194
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,560
I've already got the idea.

195
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,400
Whoa, you don't look blank anymore.

196
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,640
I got good advice from someone.

197
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,240
- Who is it?
- You don't need to know that.

198
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,040
Anyway, I'll design graphic shirts,

199
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,760
caps, and bags.

200
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,240
It's like designing my own brand.

201
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,120
Wait, are you coming with me today?

202
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,160
Fah told me you would.

203
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,160
Yeah.

204
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,000
There. Speak of the devil.

205
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,240
Why is Hia here, though?

206
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,280
What's with you?

207
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,320
Fah wouldn't help me.

208
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,160
Teerak, please help me.

209
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,760
Please, please, please.

210
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,440
Hia, what happened?

211
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,600
There's something important.

212
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,320
It's stressing me out. I don't know how to fix it.

213
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,560
It's such a big deal.

214
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,880
It's really big and serious.
You know, it's this enormous.

215
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,320
I have no solutions to it.

216
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,360
It's too difficult that I can't eat or sleep.

217
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,600
- I can't function, and my brain isn't braining.
- Hia!

218
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,480
Just get to the point.

219
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,600
Well...

220
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,120
Real and I...

221
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,760
are fighting.

222
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,680
Jeez, I thought it was something serious.

223
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,800
How did you guys fight?

224
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,280
Stop playing with my feelings!

225
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,760
You're the reason I'm like this!

226
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,520
I'm not, and I never was!

227
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,240
Fine! It's my fault.

228
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,080
Well...

229
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,440
Just how friends fight.

230
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,360
How can we help you?

231
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,760
Well...

232
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,560
Real's the worst,

233
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,400
always teasing me and running his mouth.

234
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,640
But without him,

235
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,480
I'm kinda lonely.

236
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,960
Lee,

237
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,360
Teerak,

238
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,920
please help me.

239
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,640
I'm begging you.

240
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,520
Please.

241
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,880
Help me.

242
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,200
Please.

243
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,640
Please.

244
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,800
You're afraid to say sorry to him.

245
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,760
Texting wouldn't be appropriate.

246
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,040
What do you want to do, Hia?

247
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,440
I'm not very good at talking.

248
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,480
You're not?

249
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,720
Yeah!

250
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,320
So...

251
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,680
What about reconciling with him through a letter?

252
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,960
You know, like an apology letter.

253
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,360
I think that's sincere.

254
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,560
Wouldn't that be too nice?

255
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,000
You're scared to say it to him.

256
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,080
Texting him wouldn't look sincere.

257
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,440
A letter must work very well!

258
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,080
Okay, let's do it.

259
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,680
Uh...

260
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Anyway,

261
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,280
do you guys happen to have some paper

262
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,960
and a pen?

263
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,720
Hia!

264
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,760
You literally have nothing.

265
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,200
Here you are.

266
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,400
Aw, thanks.

267
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,720
What should I write?

268
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,920
In English, though.

269
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,560
Stop that. Write it in Thai.

270
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,160
Just make sure it's from your heart.

271
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,370
- Lee.
- Yeah?

272
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,080
Mom's calling.

273
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,600
Gosh, it's getting fun.

274
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,120
Hey!

275
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,760
What about me?

276
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,640
Come on, Hia.

277
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,920
You're good at this. You can pull it off.

278
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,520
I'm rooting for you.

279
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,000
I know you can do it.

280
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,520
Let's go.

281
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,520
Fine, here goes nothing.

282
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,440
You look smart in this outfit.

283
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,800
Good thing the meeting's at the mall,
so you had a chance to change before showing up.

284
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,040
You can go now.

285
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,560
Don't worry about us.
I'll take good care of the boys.

286
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,760
I'll watch him for you for a moment.

287
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,880
Uh...

288
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,680
Work hard, Fah.

289
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,240
Okay.

290
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,840
I'll be back soon.

291
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,400
We've told you that
until we're blue in the face, but you wouldn't go.

292
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,120
Rak can make you do that with just one sentence.

293
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,200
I'll be back, Mom.

294
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,840
Okay, good luck.

295
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,960
Bye-bye.

296
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,320
Dad's been too busy to take me shopping lately,

297
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,240
so I asked Fah to bring you along as well.

298
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,040
Tell me if you want anything.

299
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,080
I'll get everything taken care of.

300
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,560
Yes, Mom.

301
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,120
Fah's changed,
so you guys need some new clothes, too.

302
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,360
Let's go.

303
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,160
Looks like I'm not her favorite anymore.

304
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,520
- Really? I also wanna check that one.
- Go ahead.

305
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,000
What about that one, Lee?

306
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,600
The clothes are from Japan.

307
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,760
Let's check it out.

308
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,600
Anything you like?

309
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,840
Um...

310
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,280
Anything caught your eye?

311
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,560
These are stunning.
I'm sure they're from the latest collection.

312
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,000
Aren't they beautiful?

313
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,040
- That one's cute.
- Punlee, Teerak, come here.

314
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,280
Try these on.

315
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,000
Aw.

316
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,880
Try these on.

317
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,710
Come on, go.

318
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,400
Yellow!

319
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,400
Wow.

320
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,160
Wow!

321
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,800
You need glasses. These are what I picked.

322
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,640
- Let's get them!
- Let's get them.

323
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,690
You need a hat!

324
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,440
So cute! Get it.

325
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,160
Wow! You look amazing.

326
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,200
I've got you a bag.

327
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,920
I have these for you.

328
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,000
Okay!

329
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,440
- Yes. Yeah, uh...
- And all the details as we discussed...

330
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,190
- Check it again, okay?
- Sure.

331
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,160
Okay, so do you agree to all of our contracts?

332
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,480
- Yeah, like that.
- Very good.

333
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,040
Everything's set.

334
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,520
- I think we're ready.
- Yeah.

335
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,940
- So...
- And we're signing here?

336
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,860
Yeah.

337
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,200
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you so much for your time.

338
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,200
- Thank you for your time.
- It's my pleasure

339
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,200
- doing business with you.
- We hope that we can do something in the future.

340
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,240
- Sure, we can do that.
- Thank you so much.

341
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,720
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you, too.

342
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,960
- Looking forward to it.
- Yeah.

343
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,320
Rak,

344
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,520
you like ice cream?

345
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,800
It's my favorite.

346
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,280
How did you know about that?

347
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,200
Fah told me that.

348
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,120
Eat up, honey.

349
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,640
Okay.

350
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,400
Seeing you and Fah being happy together

351
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,840
makes me happy, too.

352
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,960
But then there's this guy.

353
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,000
When will you date someone?

354
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,380
Tell me if you do.

355
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,680
Um...

356
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:30,710
I'm actually interested in someone.

357
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,760
- Wait, seriously?
- Hey.

358
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,440
You're interested in someone?

359
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,120
Who is it? Tell me.

360
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,440
- Come on, tell me.
- Look!

361
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,720
Dad and Fah are here.

362
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,240
Have you been waiting for long?

363
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,280
We did our best to make it quick.

364
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,040
It's been ages, honey.

365
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,080
I would've been upset
if you arrived later than this.

366
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,900
Aw, come on.

367
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,320
Please don't be mad.

368
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,440
I have something for you.

369
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,440
Aw, honey.

370
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,690
Thanks.

371
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:04,450
You two are so sweet.

372
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,880
Here's yours.

373
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,960
Thank you, Fah.

374
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,240
What is this?

375
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,120
Don't you feel bad for a single guy right here?

376
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,880
Come on, don't be upset.

377
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,520
I'll give you one.

378
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,080
- Want it?
- No.

379
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,240
It's beautiful when it's with the other ones.

380
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,160
Let's get one
from someone you're interested in, right?

381
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,240
- Right?
- What?

382
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,670
Stop that.

383
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,280
Look what you did, Dad, Fah.

384
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,920
My ice cream has lost its sweetness.

385
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,280
Let's dig in.

386
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,760
You can whisper to me. Who is it?

387
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,880
Are you blushing?

388
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,440
- Will you tell me now?
- Gosh.

389
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,000
Hey, can we talk?

390
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,160
"Dear Mr. Prarchana Phanha,

391
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,560
I, Pawee Saesong, would like to..."

392
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,600
What the heck are you doing?

393
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,720
I'm here to...

394
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,040
Can we please talk?

395
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,480
I'm not in your life anymore;

396
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,160
what else do you need?

397
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,080
I wanted to say sorry.

398
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,320
Hear me out.

399
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,840
"Dear Mr. Prarchana Phanha,

400
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,840
I, Pawee Saesong,

401
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,760
would like to write this letter to apologize

402
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,560
and tell you my feelings..."

403
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,160
"Accordingly, please forgive me.

404
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,430
Thank you."

405
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,360
You're here to apologize?

406
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,600
Obviously. Look how long my letter is.

407
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,400
I'm glad you wanted to reconcile with me.

408
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,960
Are you not mad anymore?

409
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,360
How come...

410
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,400
it's that easy?

411
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,720
Hey!

412
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,520
Give it to me.

413
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,720
You're not mad anymore, are you?

414
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,800
I'm not mad.

415
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,840
Then why did you avoid me?

416
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,880
I didn't want you to be uncomfortable.

417
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,720
Things would be awkward between us.

418
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,600
I was scared that you'd hate me.

419
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,600
I don't hate you.

420
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,520
I just...

421
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,640
You said you worried about me.

422
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,880
What did you mean by that?

423
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,800
If I answer your question,

424
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,800
will I lose you?

425
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,800
I'm not sure

426
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,440
when my feelings changed,

427
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,360
but it's been a while.

428
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,680
And you? What do you think of me?

429
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,560
As a friend...

430
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,920
or more than that?

431
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,800
Come on.

432
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,840
I don't know.

433
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,120
But...

434
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,920
I don't know...

435
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,120
what I really feel.

436
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,200
Can we be friends for now, though?

437
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,800
Can friends...

438
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,240
flirt with each other?

439
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I don't know.

440
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,040
Do whatever you want.

441
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,800
What are you talking about?

442
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,480
Flirting...

443
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,400
or this?

444
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,840
That's not how people start flirting.

445
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,700
I don't want to be just a friend anymore.

446
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,880
Why is it so quiet today?

447
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,600
Cause...

448
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,440
everyone's out.

449
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,320
Babe is with Dom.

450
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,510
My parents and grandpa are out.

451
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,720
I can't go anywhere

452
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:38,010
cause I need to finish this.

453
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,030
Good job.

454
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,240
Fah, look at these.

455
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,000
They took me so long.

456
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,120
Hey, Mookrob!

457
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,160
Stop that!

458
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,960
What's going on?

459
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,480
Mookrob just tore my model apart.

460
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,000
Can you put it together again?

461
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,360
Yes.

462
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,320
Jeez, Mookrob.

463
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,440
Teerak,

464
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,000
I'll be right back.

465
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,840
Okay.

466
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,320
Be right back.

467
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,960
For Mr. Teerak, sir.

468
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,760
It's not my order.

469
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,740
It's from Mr. Muenfah.

470
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,380
All paid.

471
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,560
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

472
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,200
What is this?

473
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,800
Something to cheer my boyfriend up.

474
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,560
The flowers can make you feel more refreshed.

475
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,640
I chose the ones in a vase,
so you can place them on a desk.

476
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,760
As for the desserts,
they can give you some energy.

477
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,760
Thanks a lot. I love them.

478
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,400
Can I get a thank you
in the form of your big smile instead?

479
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,360
I'll get back to work, then.

480
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,110
It looks so good.

481
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,720
I'll take a picture first.

00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,360
the projects we've worked on for so long
are finally coming together.

486

Freedom feels so close!

487
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,840
Before it could get any closer,

488
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,280
help me set up the booth.

489
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,240
Come on.

490
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,600
- Take it out.
- Won't you help me?

491

Come on.

492

Quickly!

493

What's with the smile, Lee?

494
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,360
What? I didn't smile.

495
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,600
You made that up.

496
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,960
You are smiling.

497
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,640
Just get back to your work.

498

Hey, where are you going?

499

00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,760
Lee, it seems like
you've become close friends with Ghlai.

511
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,200
I'm showing him my work.

512
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,240
But...

513
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,640
why won't you bring him tomorrow instead?

514
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,040
There's nothing here today.

515
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,040
He's definitely coming,

516
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,600
right?

517
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,600
Yes, I am.

518
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,440
When did they become this close?

519
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,930
I don't know.

520
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:12,170
Hey, kiddos,

521
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,760
are you guys hungry?

522
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,080
I've got you some food supplies.

523
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,480
I'm hungry.

524
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,760
Sorry for coming this late.

525
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,600
It's totally fine.

526
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,560
Gosh, they're too romantic.

527
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,920
Looking happy, huh?

528
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,880
Are you guys done fighting?

529
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,800
Yeah.

530
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,520
You two look suspicious.

531
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,360
How?

532
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,680
It's nothing.

533
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,800
Nothing?

534
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,920
You're making it even more suspicious.

535
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,840
What's going on here?

536
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,680
Nothing important.

537
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,250
I'm hitting on him; that's all.

538
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,760
- Really, Fah?
- Yeah.

539
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,520
Why don't you look excited?

540
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:12,000
Whoa, this is heaven for a BL fan like me!

541
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,410
Come on, guys.

542
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,880
Let's have some snacks.

543
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,640
I'll give them these.

544
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,320
Thanks, Real.

545
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I've designed this fox model.

546
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,640
It's a fox holding a strawberry, and...

547
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,960
These were inspired by...

548
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,240
How is it going?

549
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,360
Is it going well?

550
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,600
It's better than I expected.

551
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,880
Without your help,
I wouldn't have made it.

552
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,720
I didn't do anything.

553
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,560
All I did was give you my opinions.

554
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,280
You made it today

555
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,080
because of your own talent.

556
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,040
But without your opinions,

557
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,560
I would've had nothing to show.

558
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,000
You're exaggerating.

559
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,920
Let me treat you to a meal

560
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,120
as a thank you, okay?

561
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,080
Please.

562
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:00,040
It's an art toy of a fox in the winter...

563
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,340
There are rambutan trees in this forest.

564
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,920
However, he prefers strawberries.

565
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,600
- Hey, Teerak.
- Teerak.

566
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,640
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

567
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,240
When did you guys arrive?

568
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,320
We just got here.

569
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,480
You're doing amazing.

570
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,120
Are you tired?

571
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Not at all. In fact, I'm thrilled

572
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:24,000
that so many people like and admire my project.

573
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,920
Everyone had a smile on their face
while seeing your project.

574
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,280
You told me you wanted to make everyone happy.

575
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,960
I think...

576
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,280
you've achieved that.

577
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,280
Hello.

578
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,960
Sure, well...

579
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,640
This is a fox in the winter...

580
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,880
He's in a forest, but...

581
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:09,920
Yay!

582
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,400
This project is finally done!

583
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,560
Teerak,

584
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,880
I have something for you.

585
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,400
You're giving me this?

586
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,240
Yes.

587
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,360
A reward for doing a good job.

588
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,560
I want to give this to you.

589
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,610
But...

590
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,400
Isn't it too expensive or...

591
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,480
I think it could be useful for you.

592
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:40,720
Um...

593
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,520
Thank you, Fah.

594
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,720
My project's not worrying me anymore.

595
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,600
Next...

596
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,160
I'm going to tell my parents and grandpa
about us.

597
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,640
I believe it will turn out fine,

598
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,280
just like how everything did.

599
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,920
You can trust me.

600
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:10,970
Okay.

601
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,080
I trust you.

602
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,640
You're the best.

603
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,920
- Hi, Grandpa.
- Oh, you're back?

604
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,800
You bought that, kiddo?

605
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,640
Oh, you're back. Perfect!

606
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:46,880
- Dinner's ready.
- Hi, Mom.

607
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,920
Let's eat.

608
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,180
Rak, you're back this late?

609
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:53,120
Yes, I was putting the booth away.

610
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:56,440
Oh, the exhibition at your college?

611
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,080
- That's right.
- How did it go?

612
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,240
Everything was fine.

613
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,080
My model got so much admiration.

614
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,090
I was so happy.

615
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:05,920
- Here.
- Whoa.

616
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,170
Aw, that's cute.

617
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,560
I think you can make something out of it.

618
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,280
You wanna sell it?

619
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,600
I can contact a friend for you.

620
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,400
I'm not sure about that yet,

621
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,520
but I want to if it's possible.

622
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,320
- I see.
- Anyway,

623
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,160
we're at a dining table.

624
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,360
We don't talk business.

625
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,160
- We eat!
- Oh, okay.

626
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,760
Don't talk business.

627
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,520
But can we talk about a party?

628
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,440
Sure!

629
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,000
Alright, Grandpa's birthday is next week.

630
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,520
Where should we hold the party?

631
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,920
Thought you all have forgotten about it.

632
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:41,800
Aw.

633
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,640
I haven't.

634
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:43,480
Me neither.

635
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,760
I haven't, either!

636
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,160
I'm planning to cook
and offer the food to monks.

637
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,520
Good.

638
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,240
How about a small party in our garden?

639
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,320
Whoa, that's nice.

640
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,560
I'll bring Dom to help.

641
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,580
- That's good.
- Yes!

642
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:00,100
It's your decision. What will you say?

643
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,840
That sounds fun.

644
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,080
Let's do it.

645
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,320
I'll be the host.

646
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,640
I'll take care of everything.

647
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,680
And cook.

648
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:08,560
Whoa...

649
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,720
What? You said you'd host it.

650
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,080
- Can you please cook?
- But you said...

651
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,480
- you would do everything?
- It has to be you!

652
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,360
You need to do it.

653
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,600
- He's a good cook. Give him a chance.
- I'm not sure if it'll be edible.

654
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,480
- You need to cook.
- You don't trust your son?

655
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,120
It'll give you an upset stomach.

656
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,040
Just kidding.

657
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,440
Do you think I made the right decision?

658
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:41,340
What if I introduce Fah to my family
on Grandpa's birthday?

659
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,280
Do you think it's a good idea?

660
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:47,680
Uh...

661
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,880
Teerak, what are you doing here?

662
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:50,920
Dad!

663
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,440
How long have you been here?

664
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,560
Well, I kinda heard something like,

665
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,000
"What if I introduce Fah..."

666
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,140
Whoa.

667
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,680
Hold on.

668
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,560
So, is she older?

669
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,440
Hey!

670
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,240
You're something!

671
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:12,880
You have an older girlfriend?

672
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,320
- Uh...
- You're really something!

673
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,160
- I...
- Don't be shy.

674
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,800
I was just like you
when I was your age.

675
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,920
Bring her along! She's welcome here.

676
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,400
I'm sure Mom wants to meet her, too.

677
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,440
Wait, I'll tell her now.

678
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,280
Like father, like son, huh?

679
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,720
You're doing great.

680
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,490
- Uh...
- Perfect!

681
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:29,630
Dad...

682
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,560
Mookrob,

683
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,240
what do we do now?

684
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:14,600
What's wrong with you?

685
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,240
I'm planning to introduce Fah to my family,

686
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,480
but my Dad thinks he's a woman.

687
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:19,880
Things have changed.

688
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,130
As long as you're happy,

689
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,400
I think your parents will be, too.

690
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:23,920
I can do anything for you,

691
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,360
but I can't be more than just a friend.

692
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,600
Feeling hurt?

693
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,200
I'm worried about Teerak.

694
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:31,130
I'm sure Fah can make him feel better.

695
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,320
Don't worry, okay?

696
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,120
Smile!

697
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,920
My sky,

698
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,960
you can do it!

699
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,040
I'll do everything I can
to gain your parents' approval.

700
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,420
Get off my property, now!

701
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:43,320
- Dad...
- Leave!

702
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,960
- Dad...
- No, it can't be this way.

703
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,480
Why are you like this?

704
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,800
If I can explain it to him...
Though it needs some time...

705
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,160
That's why he doesn't understand.

706
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,040
Do you want to break up with me?
