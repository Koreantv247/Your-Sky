1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,800
You're Teerak's ex, aren't you?

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,040
If you disobey me...

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,280
It's up to you

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,800
if you want a problem.

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,710
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,970
What if...

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,300
I want you to date me again?

8
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,600
What will you say?

9
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,230
I don't think I can do that.

10
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,300
I'm sorry,

11
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,320
but I don't feel that way with you.

12
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,790
I've embraced what you taught me:

13
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,600
becoming stronger.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,440
Thank you so much

15
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,880
for making me stronger.

16
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,280

18
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,009
You should do this.

19
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,260
What's wrong?

20
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,690
Nothing.

21
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,410
- I'm alright.
- I see.

22
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:30,890
Let's go home, shall we?

23
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:32,690
Okay.

24
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,210
- I'll wear it.
- That's okay. I'll do it.

25
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,490
Okay.

26
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,390
Dad! What are you watching?

27
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,570
A teen series.

28
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,650
Join me.

29
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,440
Kids these days have amazing acting skills.

30
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,930
I'm a bit at a loss, though.

31
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,410
Where's the female lead?

32
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:19,090
Well, it's a yaoi series, Dad.

33
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:20,970
- Yaoi?
- Yeah.

34
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,850
- What is it?
- Well...

35
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,490
There. That's the lead.

36
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,180
- It's him.
- You're right.

37
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,960
The main characters are both male.

38
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:31,890
It's called a boys' love series,

39
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,810
or yaoi in Japanese.

40
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,280
I see.

41
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,250
It's fun, though.

42
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,210
Have you watched this?

43
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,530
Not yet.

44
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,570
It's my first time.

45
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,530
Is it fun?

46
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,090
Yes, it is.

47
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,060
It's cute.

48
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,930
The main guy is kinda too vain, though.

49
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,770
And he loves to tease the other one.

50
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,579
Don't forget to wash your hair.

51
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:54,810
It's all stinky now.

52
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,690
What? Nothing's funny.

53
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,090
Why did you laugh?

54
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,610
I didn't.

55
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,370
You obviously did!

56
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,050
What you said was funny.

57
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,290
- Huh?
- Let's continue.

58
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:21,730
Guys, this is so romantic.

59
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,550
Jeez, I lost again.

60
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,410
My rank just keeps going down.

61
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:28,970
Gosh.

62
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,130
Hey, if you guys wanna be over the moon,

63
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:35,860
check out this series with me.

64
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,730
It's just full of joy.

65
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,210
Another BL series?

66
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,750
Yeah, they even kissed each other on the cheeks!

67
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,570
I can't take it anymore!

68
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,250
- Let me see.
- Look.

69
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:49,850
One more game?

70
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,170
Okay. Bring it.

71
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,930
They're cute together, though.

72
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,950
I know, right? Told ya.

73
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,330
It's amazing.

74
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,560
Look at this.

75
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:01,850
I'm over the moon!

76
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:02,910
Whatever.

77
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,170
- Hey!
- Type!

78
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,210
Check this out!

79
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,530
- It's so good!
- Yeah.

80
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,820
I'm watching.

81
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,610
Hold on. Let's rewind it.

82
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,700
I couldn't catch it.

83
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:15,820
What?

84
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,490
I don't think you'll ever finish it.

85
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,180
Look!

86
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,010
Hey, Saggy Cheeks,

87
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:28,410
as a BL fan, I have a question.

88
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,650
Have you done anything with Muenfah?

89
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,250
What do you mean?

90
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,690
Being romantic

91
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:36,850
and intimate, you know?

92
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,850
Hugging, holding hands,

93
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,050
kissing cheeks,

94
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,409
or even sitting on each other's lap!

95
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,020
No.

96
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,170
- What?!
- What?

97
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:48,130
Seriously? How did you not get tricked

98
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,970
by that Scary Looker?

99
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,170
For real? You never held hands?

100
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,020
What's so surprising?

101
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:58,330
Why would he and my brother hold hands?

102
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:01,250
What? They're boyfriends.

103
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,810
They must be intimate.

104
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,450
Holding hands is basic.

105
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,370
If you don't do that,
something must be off.

106
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,450
Ever since you told everyone you're dating,

107
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,410
I've never seen you and him
being intimate at all.

108
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,090
You're right!

109
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,780
That's true.

110
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:19,720
It's odd.

111
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,890
We are intimate!
You guys just haven't seen it.

112
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,570
Right, they obviously are.

113
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,580
You're not with them.
How would you know that?

114
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:29,610
I always see them being close.

115
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,450
Yeah.

116
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,130
Real or fake?

117
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,490
I gotta go meet Muenfah now. Bye.

118
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,010
- What?
- Huh?

119
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,570
I'm thirsty. My throat hurts.

120
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:44,970
I'll go grab some water.

121
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:48,770
Something seems off, doesn't it?

122
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,409
Having nicknames...

123
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,810
That's done.

124
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,610
Uh... It's nothing.

125
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,490
Do your work.

126
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,650
I just finished it.

127
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,530
Is something wrong?

128
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:24,250
There's... something
I'm a bit worried about.

129
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,570
Not "a bit," actually.

130
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:31,250
Should we do things on the list again?

131
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:32,810
Okay.

132
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:39,490
I think we need to learn
to be more physically close.

133
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,570
- Physically close?
- Yes.

134
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,890
Joy and Type asked me

135
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,050
if we are ever intimate.

136
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,350
You know, holding hands,
hugging, or kissing cheeks.

137
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,850
I accidentally said no,

138
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:57,370
so they found it kinda suspicious.

139
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:00,420
It's probably
because we've never been physically close.

140
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,810
We need to learn to do it.

141
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,170
Don't worry.
I've already listed things we should do.

142
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,810
Fill me in.

143
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,850
Okay. First,

144
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,360
we should learn to hold hands.

145
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,780
Let's start with something simple.

146
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:15,290
That way, we won't seem awkward
being close around others.

147
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,410
Fah!

148
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,210
What are you guys doing?

149
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,050
Arm wrestling?

150
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,450
No.

151
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,330
We're holding hands.

152
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,450
You call that holding hands?

153
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:50,540
What's wrong? Isn't it cute?

154
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,050
Well...

155
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,370
It is. Yes.

156
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,930
Fine. I'll stop. Sorry, okay?

157
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:01,690
It's cute.

158
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,660
How about you do it like this?

159
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,570
I think it's a lot more adorable this way.

160
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:09,650
Hey, Fah.

161
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,810
Your fingers must be interlaced as well.

162
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,890
What is wrong with you?

163
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,930
I just wanted to show him
how couples do it.

164
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,410
I'm serious.

165
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,440
Holding hands like that

166
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,050
just looks like an arm wrestling match.

167
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,890
Thanks, Hia.

168
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:28,290
You're welcome.

169
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,450
You won't stop, huh?

170
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,850
It's late. I'll give you a ride.

171
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,890
Are you okay with it, though?

172
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,200
Yes, I am.

173
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,090
Thank you.

174
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:04,730
Uh...

175
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:08,850
We need to be more comfortable
with being physically close.

176
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,610
Okay, Naughty Baby.

177
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,260
Ghlaijai!

178
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,960
What?

179
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,400
- What do you want?
- Hey!

180
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,690
You're gonna get me killed.

181
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,290
- Here's the real deal.
- Guys! Hey!

182
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,050
Hey!

183
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,090
Type, look at them.

184
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,320
Yeah, I'm looking.

185
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:11,210
Uh...

186
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:14,250
Fah, let's meet at noon, okay?

187
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,370
Mm.

188
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,970
Fah, don't forget to pat my head.

189
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,330
See you.

190
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,570
That was terrible.

191
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,590
Cute.

192
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:53,030
- You guys were so romantic.
- Exactly.

193
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,580
Hey, is it hot?

194
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,730
Why?

195
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,210
Your ears are so red.

196
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,850
Do you want me to turn the A/C down?

197
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:12,410
No need.

198
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:15,890
I don't think it's because of the A/C,

199
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,630
but it's because of a cutie.

200
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,310
Aw!

201
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,950
I saw you come with Teerak,

202
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,790
and you guys were always holding hands.

203
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,070
Hello.

204
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,710
- Babe!
- Yeah?

205
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,270
Help!

206
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,880
- What's wrong?
- Fah's looking at me as if he's gonna kill me.

207
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,670
Help me!

208
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:44,870
You deserve it.

209
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,210
Let go of me. The class has started.

210
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,390
Let go of her, Hia!

211
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,910
Fine. She's untouchable, huh?

212
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,070
Yes.

213
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:03,670
In this class, you'll form a group of five

214
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:06,870
for your next assignment,
which is an MV production.

215
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,830
It's like she knows
I'm in the mood to film something.

216
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,270
It's what you wanted, isn't it?

217
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:17,190
The MV can be about anything,

218
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,710
but it needs a story.

219
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,310
Discuss what you wanna do
with your group members

220
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,350
and let me know at the end of this class.

221
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,890
Alright, let's start.

222
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,950
Wait, we just happened to be a group of five.

223
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,190
- Let's form a group.
- Sure.

224
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,590
I'm fine with that.

225
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,590
Fah, you?

226
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:32,870
Sure.

227
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,990
What should it be about?

228
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,670
What do you think
about an MV for a love song?

229
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,220
- Sure.
- Yeah.

230
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:42,810
Hang on. Listen to this song.

231
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,590
- What song?
- Check this out.

232
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,950
It has a beautiful meaning as well.

233
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:07,000
♫How many more times will I fall for you?♫

234
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:10,780
♫You always make my heart feel true♫

235
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:14,650
♫You're the one, my love's always been for you♫

236
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:20,050
♫For the rest of my life,
I'll spend each day loving you♫

237
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:24,570
♫No matter how long or what we go through,♫

238
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:30,420
♫I'll keep falling in love if it's with you♫

239
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:33,390
Whoa, that's beautiful.

240
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,030
You have amazing taste in music, Dom.

241
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:36,830
Dope.

242
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:37,990
I can see it in my head now.

243
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,110
Since you guys are dating,

244
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,790
just be the main roles.

245
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,670
No, it's not my thing.

246
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,910
I prefer to be behind the scenes.

247
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,710
Let's go with Fah, then.

248
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,670
Why me?

249
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,390
It's a love song.

250
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,030
Or you want me and this guy?

251
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,550
I'm fine with that.

252
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,630
I'll even perform beyond your expectations.

253
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:04,390
You're fine, but I'm not.

254
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,350
Hey, be serious this time,

255
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,390
- or she'll chew us out.
- Right.

256
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,110
Let's go with you two.

257
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,270
No.

258
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,750
Why not?

259
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,950
I agree with her.

260
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,310
It'll be too realistic.

261
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,750
- How is that a bad thing?
- Right.

262
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,670
Right.

263
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:27,790
What I mean by realistic

264
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:31,510
is how Fah and Teerak act around each other.

265
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,350
Yesterday, I saw both of them

266
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,870
hold hands as if they were arm wrestling.

267
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,110
How crazy.

268
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,870
Wait, say that again.

269
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,590
Who were holding hands?

270
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:47,070
Well, Fah and Teerak.

271
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,070
They were holding hands
in front of everyone on campus.

272
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,470
Oops...

273
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,390
You were holding my brother's hand, Fah?

274
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,550
Wait, hang on.

275
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:00,070
You and Dom do that, too.

276
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,470
Right, stop being so protective of your brother.

277
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:10,030
You guys have 20 minutes left.

278
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,070
Pawee's and Napassorn's groups
[Create a 3-minute-and-30-second music video]

279
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,940
haven't talked to me yet.

280
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,980
Come when you're ready.

281
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,590
Alright, guys. I'll summarize it, then.

282
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:25,150
So, you will be playing with Teerak, Muenfah.

283
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,470
If you guys don't agree,

284
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,280
you must be the actors.

285
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,750
Fine.

286
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,000
Fah and Teerak are fine.

287
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,510
That's how it went, Teerak.

288
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,310
Okay, and?

289
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,760
Can you please help us?

290
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,350
Sure.

291
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,440
I never act, though.

292
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,150
Are you sure it's gonna be alright?

293
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,990
Babe can help you,

294
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:50,750
right?

295
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,470
Okay, then.

296
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,510
If you don't want to do it...

297
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,230
I do! I'm willing to do it.

298
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,830
It's gonna be dope!

299
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,430
We're looking forward to it.

300
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,109
You should join us, then.

301
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,349
That way, we won't need more extras.

302
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,510
- I agree.
- Yeah.

303
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,390
Really?

304
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,150
Can I really join you guys?

305
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:11,670
Yep.

306
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,950
We're gonna be stars?

307
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,710
Do I need to do it, too?

308
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:17,950
Of course, you do.

309
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,550
Yeah, let's do it together.

310
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,030
Join us, so it'll be all of us.

311
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:24,270
Fine, I'll do it.

312
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:25,829
- Yes!
- Yes!

313
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,070
If my brother's the main role,
I'll write the screenplay.

314
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,950
- No.
- Why not?

315
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,350
If you do,

316
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:34,750
this will be an MV for the brokenhearted.

317
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:38,870
Yeah, there won't be any romantic scenes.

318
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,550
Alright, guys.

319
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,070
- I'll help Babe.
- Yeah.

320
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:45,990
No.

321
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,150
You've got a job.

322
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:50,150
I'll help Babe write the screenplay.

323
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,790
And for you,

324
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,190
now that Fah's the main character

325
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,590
and you're the best at using cameras,

326
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,030
be the cameraman.

327
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:02,070
Help Babe coach Teerak in acting, too.

328
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,630
You, Real...

329
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:08,310
You're the best at visualizing your imagination

330
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,910
and designing concepts.

331
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,390
Be the director.

332
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,830
That's it.

333
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:13,550
I'm leaving.

334
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:14,910
- What?
- Huh?

335
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:15,750
Hey!

336
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,320
He wouldn't let us say anything.

337
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,310
He's probably rushing
to catch a soccer game.

338
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,710
Yeah, I think so.

339
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,390
That's settled, then.
I'm okay with everything.

340
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,310
Okay.

341
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,550
Let's go home, Teerak.

342
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:33,030
You and Dom can go first.

343
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,710
Again?

344
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,550
I think...

345
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,150
we should leave him before he leaves us.

346
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,950
Right, it's my shift at the bar today.

347
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,810
If I stay longer,
I'll drown in their love.

348
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,830
- Don't come home late.
- Okay.

349
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,750
Let's have dinner together.

350
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,470
Sure.

351
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,710
Do you feel uncomfortable about being in our MV?

352
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:05,510
Not at all. I even feel great

353
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:09,110
to finally get to help you.

354
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,150
Are you comfortable, though?

355
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:17,040
Absolutely. It's my project.

356
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:21,750
So, we need to be serious
about being physically close now

357
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,350
so that we won't seem awkward
while being filmed.

358
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:27,590
What do you think?

359
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,310
Yeah, that's a good idea.

360
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,590
Is something wrong?

361
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:37,830
Not at all.

362
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,990
Let's dig in, shall we?

363
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:41,670
Okay.

364
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,880
We did try to be intimate yesterday,

365
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,910
but...

366
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,470
it felt odd.

367
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,350
We're not used to it yet.

368
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:02,390
Yeah, he doesn't want
to make you feel uncomfortable.

369
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:06,830
It would make your relationship
seem even more fake, though.

370
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,630
Um...

371
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,850
What should I do?

372
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,750
Since you guys know more
about each other now,

373
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:16,390
just try to be physically closer to him.

374
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,310
I did try, but...

375
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,590
it didn't work.

376
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,190
Where did you guys do it?

377
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,430
At his bar yesterday.

378
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,070
I knew it.

379
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:33,000
It's not private, Teerak.

380
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,470
You guys were afraid of others' looks.

381
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,350
Um...

382
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,270
Maybe you're right.

383
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:43,350
So, come to my house tomorrow.

384
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,990
He's home today.

385
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,470
Just do it at my home.

386
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,470
Are you sure?

387
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,510
Yeah.

388
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,660
How do we start?

389
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,510
Start simply.

390
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,190
Try being physically closer to him

391
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,980
and getting comfortable
with touching each other,

392
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:59,840
and you'll know what to do.

393
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,710
Do some activities together.

394
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:03,990
Like what?

395
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:05,830
Well...

396
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:09,870
Something couples do.

397
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,630
I mean...

398
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:17,190
I'm talking about something
you and Fah have in common.

399
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,270
Okay. Thanks a lot, Lee.

400
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:22,010
I'll text Fah now.

401
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,490
Okay.

402
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:24,950
Bye-bye.

403
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:34,230
Fah,

404
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,350
will you be home tomorrow?

405
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,190
Yeah.

406
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:44,870
[Teerak: Are you free tomorrow?]

407
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,990
[Teerak: Let's learn to be intimate]

408
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:56,390
[Muenfah: Sure, I'll be home tomorrow;
I'll pick you up]

409
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:59,250
[Teerak: It's okay; I'll come to you this time]

410
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:02,630
[Teerak: Just send me your location]

411
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,830
[Muenfah: Okay]

412
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,150
Oh...

413
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,030
I'm sorry.

414
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:42,110
Whoa!

415
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:49,950
Fah, how come you have a pool this big
in your house?

416
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:54,110
I wanted a pool like this when I was a kid,

417
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:57,230
but my dad made it so tiny,

418
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,630
so I can't swim in it anymore.

419
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,790
Do you wanna swim?

420
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,730
- Can I?
- Mm.

421
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,470
I'm good.

422
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:10,110
I don't have any spare clothes.

423
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,750
You can wear mine.

424
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,780
I already feel so bad bothering you so much.

425
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,270
Should we go inside, then?

426
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:18,270
Yes.

427
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:29,630
Oh...

428
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,470
Let's go.

429
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:50,710
Are you hungry?

430
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,140
Um...

431
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,470
I'm still full.

432
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,030
Thanks.

433
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,350
Wait...

434
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,790
Wanna sit with me?

435
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:06,790
That's okay.

436
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,390
Can I help you?

437
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:19,270
That's okay. I can do it, sir.

438
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,310
She's Nial, our wet nurse.

439
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:25,950
Good morning, Master.

440
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,820
Good morning, I'm Teerak,

441
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,790
or you can call me Rak.

442
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,910
You don't need to call me "Master."

443
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:36,150
My master's friends are my masters as well.

444
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,870
Please allow me to call you that.

445
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:00,870
Fah, I have something to ask you.

446
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,110
Yes?

447
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:10,650
I'm now designing an art toy.

448
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,550
Can you give some comments?

449
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,870
Are you not comfortable yet?

450
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,510
I'm sorry.

451
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,990
You don't like it, do you?

452
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:54,190
I just wanted us to be comfortable
with being intimate,

453
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:57,870
but I forgot that...

454
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:00,310
you could've felt forced.

455
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:03,470
Then, from now on,

456
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,550
please allow me to touch you.

457
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,880
Can I see the sketch you've made?

458
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,210
Here.

459
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,360
Where is it?

460
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,880
- Do you need help?
- Hold on.

461
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:32,310
Oh...

462
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,840
- Mm...
- Look at his nose...

463
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,950
Master...

464
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,750
Is something wrong?

465
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,230
Not anymore, Master.

466
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,990
- Enjoy yourselves.
- Okay.

467
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,110
Why are you here?

468
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,370
Give me a moment.

469
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,730
No.

470
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:29,840
I want to help you cook.

471
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,740
Do you even know how to cook?

472
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,220
Yeah, I've helped my mom.

473
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,780
Um...

474
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,140
Can you cut the vegetables for me?

475
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,020
Wait!

476
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,740
Yes?

477
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,300
Put the knife down.

478
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,060
Fah,

479
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,660
we've talked about this.

480
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,980
Alright, okay.

481
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,980
Come on, I'll teach you.

482
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:35,820
Teach me how to cook
or to do something else?

483
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,780
How couples spend time together.

484
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:57,580
Couples do this, don't they?

485
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,210
Hold it like this

486
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,500
so that it won't cut your fingers.

487
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,540
Teerak,

488
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,300
are you okay?

489
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,140
Of course.

490
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,940
You're actually good at this.

491
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,020
At cutting vegetables?

492
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,380
We just started.

493
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,340
At showing love.

494
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,100
I'm not,

495
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,420
but I'm learning it from you.

496
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:30,410
Whoa, it's my first time, though.

497
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,260
It looks better than I expected.

498
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,580
You told me you helped your mom, though.

499
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,940
Well...

500
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,660
I helped her rinse the vegetables.

501
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,740
I'm lucky the dishes turned out nice.

502
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,540
Not yet, Fah!

503
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,900
I'll take some pics first.

504
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,540
Choo-choo!

505
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,760
Choo-choo!

506
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,780
Is it good?

507
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,060
Yes!

508
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,550
Oh,

509
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,540
that's rude.

510
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,620
What is it?

511
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,580
I hate Muenfah.

512
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,180
Mom,

513
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,700
you need to help me.

514
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,260
If you don't,

515
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,700
I'll leak the video of him punching me
to embarrass him!

516
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:48,580
You want it to give you even more trouble?

517
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,420
Get a grip.

518
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,540
I've warned you once.

519
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,220
Mom!

520
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,540
Have you ever cared about me,

521
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,910
or are you more worried about your title?

522
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,020
Oh, I'm your mom.

523
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,540
Watch your language.

524
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,860
I'm sorry.

525
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,500
Stop!

526
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,940
Come back.

527
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,540
Sit down.

528
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,980
About that Muenfah guy,

529
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,980
I'll deal with him.

530
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,460
What are you gonna do?

531
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,820
You want revenge, don't you?

532
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,100
I have my ways.

533
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,740
Just lie low

534
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,170
and try to be nice.

535
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:54,100
Don't cause me any more trouble.

536
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,140
Thank you for taking care of Mai, Jade.

537
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,260
No worries.

538
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,460
It's been a long journey, hasn't it?

539
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,739
Not at all.

540
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,340
Kanchanaburi is not far from Bangkok.

541
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,260
Mai's mentioned your name a lot.

542
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:18,980
It's good to see you.

543
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,239
Yes.

544
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:26,340
Mai probably relied on your help a lot
during his internship.

545
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:31,389
Not at all. He helped me.

546
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,340
I'm sorry.

547
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:49,100
It's okay.

548
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,659
If you're sleepy,

549
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,460
you can lie on my lap.

550
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,179
Come on.

551
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,860
Teerak...

552
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,060
Give me five minutes.

553
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,820
That's not a comfy place to sleep.

554
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,620
Do you wanna go somewhere better?

555
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,460
This feels so nice.

556
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,580
Are we close now?

557
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:08,370
Yes.

558
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:14,940
Do you think we're like a couple now?

559
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,820
Almost.

560
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:21,450
Why would you say "almost"?

561
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:23,690
We haven't done everything.

562
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:27,570
And...

563
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:30,370
what is it that we haven't done?

564
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:45,890
Don't joke around like this.

565
00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:01,290
You should do it
with someone you're really into.

566
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:08,570
What if this is not a joke?

567
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:36,770
Rak...

568
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:39,090
Rak...

569
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:49,330
Rak.

570
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:51,010
Are you okay?

571
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,530
Uh... I...

572
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:07,770
I had a weird dream,

573
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:09,080
and it shocked me.

574
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:13,530
What was your dream?
Why were you that shocked?

575
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:15,130
Uh...

576
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:19,800
It was nothing.

577
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:24,730
The couch might've been uncomfy,

578
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:26,330
so I took you here.

579
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:29,290
I'm awake now.

580
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:31,370
I'm all awake and feeling fresh!

581
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:33,890
Uh...

582
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:36,210
I'm going home, then.

583
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:37,850
It's getting dark.

584
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:39,770
My family will be worried.

585
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:01,010
I'll give you a ride.

586
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,130
Okay.

587
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:19,810
Yes.

588
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:22,650
Yes, I'm in front of our house, Grandpa.

589
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:25,090
Okay, bye.

590
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:29,420
Thank you for giving me a ride.

591
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:33,090
I gotta go now.

592
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:34,450
Uh...

593
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:36,730
Did I upset you?

594
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:38,770
Uh...

595
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:39,970
No.

596
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:41,210
You don't need to worry.

597
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:43,370
I'm leaving now.

598
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:44,530
My grandpa's waiting.

599
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:17,970
What? You're home?

600
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:22,730
What's wrong?

601
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,450
Didn't you just take Rak home?

602
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:27,690
Yeah.

603
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,290
Let me ask you something.

604
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:30,330
Yeah?

605
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:32,250
What does it mean

606
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:33,890
when someone avoids you?

607
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:36,670
I think...

608
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:39,010
they either hate you

609
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:41,750
or don't like something you did.

610
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:48,360
Why?

611
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:50,130
Was Rak running away from you?

612
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:56,910
How come their intimacy training
turned out like this?

613
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:01,570
If he's unhappy or mad,

614
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:03,250
he'll avoid me, won't he?

615
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:07,290
I don't know. I've never experienced it.

616
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:09,730
But if I have to guess,

617
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:11,170
I think that's correct.

618
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:16,010
You might've made him blush, though.

619
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:17,330
Who knows?

620
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:30,890
Is that a smile?

621
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:32,930
What? No!

622
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:44,930
He's not avoiding you.

623
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:46,490
You made him blush, for sure.

624
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:14,530
What is wrong with me?

625
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:16,770
Is it because...

626
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:19,610
Grandpa once said
we shouldn't sleep in the evening.

627
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:22,690
Teerak, who are you talking to?

628
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:27,360
Rak!

629
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:29,250
Yes?

630
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:30,850
What did you say?

631
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:33,010
What's wrong?
Why didn't you answer me?

632
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:36,410
Babe, something's wrong with me.

633
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:38,410
My heart beats pretty fast.

634
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:40,870
What? What's wrong?

635
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:42,970
Tell me.

636
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:44,610
It's pounding.

637
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:46,050
Have you had coffee?

638
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:49,330
No.

639
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:52,010
I think I'm getting a cold!

640
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:53,810
Do I need to see the doctor?

641
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:55,930
Calm down. It's not that bad.

642
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:57,170
How long have you been feeling this?

643
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:59,850
It started this evening

644
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:01,930
when I was...

645
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:08,370
You were what?

646
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:12,050
Nothing.

647
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:14,970
It's probably because I slept in the evening.

648
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:17,170
That's why I'm not feeling good.

649
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:18,770
Have you taken the medicine?

650
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:20,450
I have.

651
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:21,410
Okay.

652
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:23,850
I'll go to bed, then.

653
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:25,010
Goodnight, Babe.

654
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:26,210
Hold on, Teerak.

655
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:37,130
I was gonna tell you
the practice's tomorrow at noon.

656
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,250
You know,
the MV you said you'd help us.

657
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:40,770
Okay.

658
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:50,450
Will he be okay?

659
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:58,410
Have you added the breakdown
I wrote last night to the slides?

660
00:44:58,810 --> 00:45:00,930
Of course. I never forget things.

661
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:02,730
Have you made the link accessible?

662
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:06,050
Shit.

663
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:08,050
You never forget things, huh?

664
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:11,410
Shut it!

665
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:13,330
Alright, guys.

666
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:16,040
If you are ready,
you can start your presentation now.

667
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:17,410
Please.

668
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:19,850
What order should our group present in?

669
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:20,890
Third.

670
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:22,210
Why third?

671
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:23,930
So that an idiot asks.

672
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:28,660
Hello, our group is going to...

673
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:30,340
make an MV for a breakup song.
[An MV for a breakup song]

674
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:31,770
Thank you.

675
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:38,650
- You guys are next, right?
- Yeah.

676
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:40,310
- We're after you, okay?
- Okay.

677
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:44,680
We're going to make an MV for a country song
[An MV for a country song]

678
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:46,690
that's going viral on TikTok right now.

679
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:51,090
Let's go.

680
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:52,130
Let's do it.

681
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:58,930
Hello, we are going to make an MV
for a love song.

682
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:02,050
The story will follow a relationship

683
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:04,970
that slowly blossoms
from acquaintances to lovers.

684
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:08,970
Both of the main characters are men

685
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,890
because we'd like to point out that

686
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,400
love has no gender.

687
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:18,770
Mm, that's interesting.

688
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:19,820
Great.

689
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:24,650
As for the setting,
we're planning to film the MV at a hotel by the sea.

690
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,440
That's a high-budget project.

691
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:30,080
Have you talked it out
with the actors, though?

692
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:31,610
Yes, you don't need to worry.

693
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:33,530
We have discussed it already.

694
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:34,730
Okay.

695
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:39,650
This is the breakdown we've written.

696
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:46,190
Wow, you guys even have a script breakdown.

697
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:48,370
That's nice. Good job.

698
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:50,210
You guys are well prepared.

699
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:51,450
I don't think
I want to change anything.

700
00:46:51,490 --> 00:46:52,850
You may get the ball rolling now.

701
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:57,130
Alright, that's it for our presentation.

702
00:46:57,170 --> 00:46:58,330
Thank you.

703
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,650
Jeez, I was happy for just a few seconds,

704
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:08,500
and he's doing it again.

705
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:09,920
Look at Fah.

706
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:11,170
How cute.

707
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:12,690
Show me your gadgets.

708
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:14,090
You have some?

709
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:31,890
That's...

710
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:33,330
Hi, guys.

711
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:34,050
Oh...

712
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:35,910
My mom made some desserts for you guys.

713
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:38,330
Whoa, thanks.

714
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:44,220
Oh, Teerak.

715
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:46,230
Perfect.

716
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:47,970
I've got you water

717
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:49,930
in case you're thirsty.

718
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:51,770
Thanks, Hia.

719
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:53,250
Let's swap.

720
00:47:55,890 --> 00:47:57,650
Thanks, Teerak.

721
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:00,730
That's so kind of you.

722
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:02,290
Unlike you,

723
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:05,610
- Babe never gets us any dessert.
- What?

724
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,560
If you don't want that, just give it to me.

725
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:09,530
Hey, stop that.

726
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:11,510
Since we're all here,

727
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:14,210
let's start with the key scene.

728
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:15,860
Did you bring your script?

729
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:17,130
Yes.

730
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:19,930
Did you work on it, too?

731
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:21,490
I've read it briefly,

732
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:23,090
and I remember what to do.

733
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:27,930
So, let's start
from where both of the main characters

734
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:29,930
sit on the beach.

735
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:31,410
Let's give it a try.

736
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:32,930
Let's set up the blocking.

737
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:33,970
- Let's go.
- Come on, Fah.

738
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:35,690
You can do it.

739
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:37,810
- Leave your bag here.
- Thanks.

740
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:39,050
Sit here.

741
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:40,090
Right here.

742
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:41,050
Teerak, sit there.

743
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:43,590
Okay.

744
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:47,730
Okay, slowly close your eyes

745
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:48,890
and focus.

746
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:49,930
Now.

747
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:52,330
Don't forget to breathe.

748
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:58,290
Then, imagine you're at the beach.

749
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:00,890
You can hear the waves coming closer,

750
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:02,730
the birds chirping,

751
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:04,650
and the leaves moving on one another.

752
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:06,890
Focus on your posture, too.

753
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:09,290
If it's not comfortable, you may change it.

754
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:10,610
Stretching your legs is fine.

755
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:13,890
Okay.

756
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:18,850
Now, Fah, gently place your hand on Teerak's.

757
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:20,150
Gently.

758
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:28,610
Alright.

759
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:32,530
Slowly open your eyes
and meet each other's gaze.

760
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:36,770
Take it slow.

761
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:46,390
Now do as the script says.

762
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:48,350
Don't rush it, though, Fah.

763
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:51,330
Wait until you feel it before you approach him.

764
00:49:51,370 --> 00:49:54,170
If you don't wanna kiss him yet, just wait.

765
00:49:54,810 --> 00:49:55,610
Okay.

766
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:26,850
Cut!

767
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:27,730
Cut.

768
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:28,530
Stop there.

769
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:30,320
Jeez, Babe!

770
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:31,610
Why did you do that?

771
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:33,690
I can't stand it.

772
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:35,170
Can you give me a second?

773
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:36,690
For what?

774
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:38,330
You're not even the cast!

775
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:41,290
Yeah, my brother's still a kid.

776
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:44,410
Fine, I'll give you only 10 minutes.

777
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:46,670
But I've been taking care of him for 20 years.

778
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:49,850
10 minutes. That's all.

779
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:51,460
- Babe...
- Do you want this to be done?

780
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,530
Or we won't get to finish it.

781
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:53,860
He's a grown-up man now.

782
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:55,770
Fine.

783
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:57,620
- They're cute together.
- 10 minutes, then.

784
00:50:58,010 --> 00:50:59,210
Why are you worried now?

785
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:02,770
What's wrong? Why are you quiet?

786
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:06,930
I think I'm getting sick.

787
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:10,040
Are you okay?

788
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,200
Babe, I'm feeling ill again.

789
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:14,490
Really?

790
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:15,650
Just like yesterday?

791
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:16,850
Let me see.

792
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:19,410
You don't have a fever, though.

793
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:21,370
What should we do?

794
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:22,910
Let's call it a day.

795
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:26,490
You guys should take him home.

796
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:27,930
- Okay.
- I'll clean up and close this room.

797
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:31,210
I'll take him home right away, then.

798
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:33,770
Hey, his sister is here.

799
00:51:33,810 --> 00:51:34,810
He can come with me.

800
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:37,130
I can leave with Babe.

801
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:39,370
I think it'll be better after some rest.

802
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:40,650
Let's go.

803
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:42,090
Get home safely, Fah.

804
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:44,250
- Bye, see you.
- I'll get your stuff.

805
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:47,290
Let's go.

806
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:02,450
We're home.

807
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:04,530
- Hi, Grandpa, Dad.
- Hi.

808
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:06,290
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

809
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:08,250
Mom, Teerak's feeling sick.

810
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:11,290
What? What's wrong?

811
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:13,330
Was the sun or wind too strong?

812
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:15,930
You're so red.

813
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:17,290
I'm good now.

814
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:19,250
I think your hands have magic.

815
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:21,770
Don't be so cute.

816
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:23,010
I'll get you some fruit.

817
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:25,010
Take a seat.

818
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:28,770
How are you?

819
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:31,030
Has it been a long day?

820
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:32,690
No.

821
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:34,530
Here.

822
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:37,250
- Dad.
- Yes?

823
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:39,530
Teerak and I are going
to the beach this weekend.

824
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:41,200
Hold on.

825
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:44,090
The beach in the rainy season?
You think it's safe?

826
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:47,380
We need to finish a project soon,
so we have to do it now.

827
00:52:47,850 --> 00:52:48,850
Do what?

828
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:51,370
We're completing a group assignment.

829
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:53,170
Teerak and his friends are coming, too.

830
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:54,810
They'll be our extras.

831
00:52:56,250 --> 00:53:00,090
You love it, huh? Going to the beach.

832
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,330
He obviously does.

833
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:04,130
I don't know if he'll get better before we go.

834
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:05,670
I will!

835
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:06,570
Whoa.

836
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:07,890
See? I've taken my medicine.

837
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:09,010
Hey, honey.

838
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:10,610
Don't talk while you have food in your mouth.

839
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:13,250
Come on. Let them go on some trips

840
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:15,050
and enjoy their lives.

841
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:16,450
Fine.

842
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:20,410
Alright, you can go,
but you need to take care of each other.

843
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:21,570
Make sure you don't get sick.

844
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:22,530
Okay.

845
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:23,290
Yay!

846
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:26,100
I'll get everyone a lot of snacks!

847
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:29,450
Go get some rest now.

848
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:30,510
Okay, Grandpa.

849
00:53:30,770 --> 00:53:32,770
- Rest up.
- Hold on.

850
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:35,610
Let me give you a kiss.

851
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:38,130
- Let him rest.
- Oops, I ruined your hair.

852
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:40,050
Come on, let's go.

853
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:40,810
- Go.
- Goodbye.

854
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:42,290
- Don't forget to take a shower.
- Got it.

855
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:43,890
- I'm going upstairs, too.
- Okay.

856
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:45,130
Teerak, wait up!

857
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:10,290
Hello?

858
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:12,210
Are you asleep?

859
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,210
I just woke up.

860
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:17,210
Is everything okay?

861
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:19,570
I've brought you some pills.

862
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:21,890
- You brought me pills?
- Yes.

863
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:24,010
I'll hang them on the fence.

864
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:25,650
You can get them later.

865
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:28,010
I'll be there now.

866
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:29,530
Give me a moment.

867
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:44,610
Why are you here this late?

868
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:47,370
I just got off work.

869
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:50,310
You're sick, so I bought you some pills.

870
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:54,930
Will you be able to go to the beach, though?

871
00:54:55,490 --> 00:54:56,850
Do you want me to postpone it?

872
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:59,250
It's okay. I'm good now.

873
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:08,170
Thank you for caring about me.

874
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:10,010
Tell me if you can't go.

875
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:11,530
Don't feel bad.

876
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:13,450
I can, for sure!

877
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:16,570
I really, really, really want to go to the beach.

878
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:24,930
I care about you.

879
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:33,090
I'm sorry for coming this late.

880
00:55:34,190 --> 00:55:34,820
That's...

881
00:55:36,450 --> 00:55:37,650
That's fine!

882
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:40,370
You should rest now.

883
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:45,730
Are you leaving now?

884
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:46,650
Yes.

885
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:49,500
Drive safely.

886
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:51,370
Okay.

887
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:52,770
Goodnight, Naughty Baby.

888
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:33,570
Signs of falling in love

889
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,040
with someone.

890
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:37,640
You feel overjoyed around that person.

891
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:39,740
You smile more often.

892
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:43,720
You have butterflies in your stomach
being around that person.

893
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:46,360
It felt very genuine
when you played the scene.

894
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:48,040
What was on your mind
when you were doing it?

895
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:49,300
Well, it's...

896
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,320
Action!

897
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:54,280
Fah, I have something to tell you.

898
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,620
I'm sorry.

899
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:00,330
I like you, Fah.
