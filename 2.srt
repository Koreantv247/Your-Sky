1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
I'd like to invite you
to my birthday party tomorrow.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,480
I promise you that if you're going there,

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,320
I'll stop messing with you

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,000
and will not make you feel uncomfortable.

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,840
Oh is so mean and rude!

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,360
You made me drunk.

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:16,720
Hey!

8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,400
What's your problem?

9
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,320
Of course, it's my problem.

10
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,280
He's my boyfriend.

11
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,200
Can you give me
a kiss on the head, Dad?

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,770
Dad won't kiss me on the head!

13
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,560
Dad only loves Babe.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,310
I did.

15
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:42,790
[Punlee: Saggy Cheeks, explain to me now]

16
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,030
[Type: Why did you let him
kiss you on your head, Saggy Cheeks!?]

17
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,270
[Babe: We need to talk! Now!]

18
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:46,670
[Joy: Wait, with Muenfah? Spill it!]

19
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,120
[Dom: Babe is really mad now, Teerak]

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:48,920
[Punlee: You and Fah?]

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,110
[Type: I can't believe this]

22
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:51,720
[Joy: Saggy Cheeks!]

23
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,400
[Type: You're joking]

24
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,560
[Babe: Why did you and Muenfah come home together?]

25
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,720
[Joy: Don't ghost me; explain now!]
[Dom: Please call Babe; I can't take it anymore T_T]

26
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,960
No!!

27
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,240
Argh.

28
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,479
Was that a dream?

29
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,640
What a relief.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,840
Teerak!

31
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,150
You asked for trouble last night.

32
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,360
Why did Fah kiss you on the head?

33
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,800
Kiss me on the head!

34
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,030
Give me a kiss on the head.

35
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,870
Kiss me on the head!

36
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,640
I did.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,200
So?

38
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,200
What do I do?

39
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,440

41
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,410
Was it really not a dream?

42
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,170
Ouch.

43
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,950
Ouch, that hurts, Babe.

44
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,640
It better did
so that you know what you've done.

45
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,000
Argh.

46
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,880
Babe, my head aches.

47
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:36,000
Don't even try to trick me.

48
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,820
You can't.

49
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,690
You haven't answered
any of my questions.

50
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,000
Why were you drunk?

51
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,650
Why did Muenfah take you here,
and why did he kiss you on the head?

52
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,480
Uh...

53
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,320
If you don't give me the answers,
I'll find them on my own.

54
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,320
How will you do that?

55
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,670
Asking the one who gave you the lift.

56
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,680
Babe!

57
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,580
Nope, stop that.

58
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,520
Just leave.

59
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,200
Right, don't forget
to thank Muenfah as well

60
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,240
for giving you the lift and taking
care of you while you were drunk.

61
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,980
- Got it?
- Yes.

62
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,520
Are you telling me this
so I can give him a lesson?

63
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,420
You need to help me.

64
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,080
I can't just sit back
after what he did to me.

65
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,600
Just shut his place down.

66
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,390
Oh,

67
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,920
I can't help you with that.

68
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,380
I'm a college president.

69
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,880
Think it through.

70
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,940
What if Teerak fights us back?

71
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,600
- Mom, but...
- Oh!

72
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,700
If this ever defames me,

73
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,820
you know what I'll do, don't you?

74
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,640
If you still wanna go to a Thai college,
just focus on your studies.

75
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,580
Don't make a big deal out of it.

76
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,420
He's not mad.

77
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,560
He is.

78
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,040
I'm sorry.

79
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,880
He's probably not.

80
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,200
I don't think he is.

81
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,250
He is.

82
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,760
He's not.

83
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,670
Gosh.

84
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,200
Muenfah!

85
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,880
Uh...

86
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:15,960
Well...

87
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,810
I'm sorry for messing up your shirt.

88
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,480
I had it washed and
kept in your locker already.

89
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,840
I don't know if you've noticed it.

90
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,800
Yes, I have.

91
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,090
I'm sorry about last night, too.

92
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,670
You know, for making you take me home.

93
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,990
It's okay.

94
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,360
I'm sorry, too.

95
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,980
Why would you be?

96
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,150
I was too mad,

97
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,910
so I told everyone we were together

98
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,470
when I punched Oh.

99
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,110
What?

100
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,890
You punched him?

101
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,020
And... what did you tell everyone?

102
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,680
I said we were a couple.

103
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,870
I'm sorry.

104
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,010
That's alright.

105
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,400
I know you were just trying to help me.

106
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,190
I'm sorry for giving you a hard time.

107
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,179
So...

108
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,390
I don't think Oh's very pleased about this.

109
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,640
I'm sorry for getting you in trouble.

110
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,940
Mm.

111
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,700
And...

112
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,370
Uh...

113
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,950
Nothing!

114
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,200
Thank you so much for helping me.

115
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,910
I'm not gonna hold you back anymore.

116
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,110
Don't forget to wash your hair.

117
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,320
It's all stinky now.

118
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,080
What?

119
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,320
Hey, Rak.

120
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,120
Is my hair stinky?

121
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,960
I'm sorry.

122
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,240
I'm sorry, too.

123
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,880
Oh didn't do anything to you, did he?

124
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,700
No.

125
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,660
He didn't

126
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,680
because Muenfah was there to save me.

127
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,420
- What?
- What?

128
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,680
- Muenfah?
- What does he have to do with this?

129
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:36,240
Lee, tell me what happened.

130
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,000
Told you.

131
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,170
You were too drunk to remember a thing.

132
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,440
I asked you guys to protect him,

133
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,400
but you enjoyed those drinks so much.

134
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,620
Too bad, wasn't it?

135
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,770
I'm sorry, okay?

136
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:52,680
Tell me every detail
of what happened, though.

137
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,920
So, what is it then?

138
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,050
What does it have to do with Muenfah?

139
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,040
I'm all confused.

140
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,390
Mm...

141
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,860
He punched...

142
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,760
What's wrong, Joy?

143
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,320
Hey.

144
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,200
Are you okay?

145
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,200
So?

146
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,090
Tell me.

147
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,790
Honestly, I don't remember all of it.

148
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,600
All I know is that Muenfah...

149
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,340
punched Oh last night.

150
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,910
And...

151
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,260
about what you're wondering...

152
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,560
Here, Babe took a picture of us.

153
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,760
I...

154
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,280
I don't even know
what to be shocked by first.

155
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,760
Do you know that
you've caused trouble again?

156
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,100
I do.

157
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,620
What should I do, Lee?

158
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,120
I already apologized
and thanked him, though.

159
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,710
I told him myself.

160
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,140
I also gave him this...

161
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,640
This dessert.

162
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,640
This dessert...

163
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,640
I'll be right back!

164
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,960
Hey, where are you going?

165
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,600
Rak!

166
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,290
Teerak!

167
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,120
- Where are you going?
- Have you seen Muenfah?

168
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,160
Muenfah?

169
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,560
He's on the rooftop with Oh.

170
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,800
With Oh?

171
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,650
Yeah.

172
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,440
Hey, Teerak!

173
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,360
What's wrong with him?

174
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,060
- Hello, Professor.
- Hi.

175
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,690
Do you know where Oh is?

176
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,380
You think you can just
punch me and call it a day?

177
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,680
What do you want?

178
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,090
I'm not just going to let someone
punch me for nothing.

179
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,210
I'll give you a chance

180
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,000
to tell me the truth about you and Teerak.

181
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,660
You're not a couple, are you?

182
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,240
Tell me.

183
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,720
Speak!

184
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,250
Answer my question!

185
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,240
Muenfah, give me the answer.

186
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,120
Teerak,
you're not his boyfriend, are you?

187
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,920
Did he lie to me?

188
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,960
He did not.

189
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,720
Muenfah and I

190
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,560
are really boyfriends.

191
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,800
You've always been with me.

192
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,720
I've never seen you talk to anybody,

193
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,360
so how could you be dating Muenfah?

194
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,920
Well, are you mad at me?

195
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,910
Is that why you're hurting me
by pretending to be his boyfriend?

196
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,610
I'm not doing this to hurt anyone.

197
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,400
We really are a couple.

198
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,050
I don't buy that.

199
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,240
That's not true.

200
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,270
Hey!

201
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,090
What's going on here?

202
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,320
Oh, it's you.

203
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,080
You're right here.
I was looking for you.

204
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,440
Hello, Professor.

205
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,810
I need your help.

206
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,240
I'd like to give something to your mother.

207
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,320
Please follow me.

208
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,540
Yes, Professor.

209
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,160
Oh!

210
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,790
Come on.

211
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,060
Yes, Professor.

212
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,200
Hey.

213
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,050
You better go with the professor.

214
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,360
This can wait.

215
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,520
Come on.

216
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,360
Come on, bro.

217
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,240
Hurry.

218
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,080
Don't you dare think this is it.

219
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,640
Uh, I'm sorry.

220
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,200
I'm the one who should apologize.

221
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,440
I'm sorry for telling everyone
we were a couple.

222
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,560
But... you were just helping me.

223
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,210
So...

224
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,840
everyone at the party
believed we were together?

225
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,540
What should we do?

226
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,540
Do we really have to
pretend we're a couple?

227
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,320
If everyone finds out the truth,

228
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,600
how bad will it be?

229
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,280
In my opinion, telling them now

230
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,460
is not a good idea, either.

231
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,280
If we admit that it was just a lie,

232
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,210
Oh won't just let it slide.

233
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,430
I think we have 2 options.

234
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,960
First, I'll tell everyone
there's nothing between us.

235
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,840
Second, we'll just keep pretending
we're a couple.

236
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,520
However, I do believe that
the second one is the best option.

237
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,960
That's what Oh believed, anyway.

238
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,630
I think it's best

239
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,180
that we pretend to be together.

240
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,700
That way, Oh will leave you alone

241
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,070
and stop messing with me.

242
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,520
It's a win-win for both of us.

243
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,560
If you don't think it's
a good idea, that's okay.

244
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,890
I'm in.

245
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,000
A win-win for both of us.

246
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,840
But...

247
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,760
I'm not good at expressing my feelings.

248
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,000
It's not my thing.

249
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,510
That's totally fine.

250
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,760
I think I can do it.

251
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,040
Okay.

252
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,480
I'll leave it to you, then.

253
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,020
Let's make a pinky promise
to keep this secret just between us.

254
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,300
I mean...

255
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,000
that we'll pretend to be a couple.

256
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,440
Yay!

257
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,990
So we've agreed to fake
being together, okay?

258
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:55,090
Yes.

259
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,740
Can I ask you something?

260
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,510
Are you gonna tell Babe
about what Oh did to you last night?

261
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,350
If she finds out,
she won't leave him alone.

262
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,390
But if my dad knows...

263
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,960
What about us faking being together?

264
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:32,920
I'm not sure who I should tell about this.

265
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,370
I think Babe should know this.

266
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,220
If she asks,

267
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,630
you should tell her the truth.

268
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,040
It's better that way.

269
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,540
What is it?

270
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,000
You need to attend your class now, right?

271
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,440
Yes, you too, right?

272
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,600
You're right! I totally forgot.

273
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,870
Let's talk after class, then.

274
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,640
At the coffee shop in Building A, okay?

275
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,160
Okay.

276
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,840
I'll get going now.

277
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,450
Right.

278
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,890
I almost forgot.

279
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:18,010
Here's a dessert

280
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,760
as my apology.

281
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,230
I forgot to give it to you.

282
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,160
Okay.

283
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,520
Thank you.

284
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,230
I'll go to class now.

285
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,600
Study hard, okay?

286
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,380
- Okay.
- I'll see you this evening.

287
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,340
Bye.

288
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,180
Guys, I think throwing up is contagious.

289
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,630
What do you mean?

290
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,280
I threw up when I saw you did.

291
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,520
You were drunk.

292
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,280
Where have you been?

293
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,560
You even left your phone here.

294
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,090
Well, I was...

295
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,520
Joy!

296
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,920
Do you feel better now?

297
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,040
Yeah, I do.

298
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,000
And what was the story?

299
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,080
What does Muenfah have to do with this?

300
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,260
Nothing.

301
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,080
He was just helping me

302
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,600
cause I'm Lee's friend.

303
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,530
I don't remember how he helped me, though.

304
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,680
That's all?

305
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,320
Jeez, this is boring.

306
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,220
You want something fun?

307
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,840
- Check this out.
- What?

308
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,120
Well, May just told me

309
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:36,230
that In from Civil Engineering
is dating Minnie from our faculty.

310
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,920
- Minnie?
- Yeah.

311
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,960
Since when?

312
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,360
Type, it's totally fake.

313
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,170
It's fake news.

314
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:45,360
I just saw him hanging
out with some other girl.

315
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,600
- I don't think they're together.
- I knew it.

316
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,390
People's business is my concern.

317
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,880
I'm sure they're not a couple,

318
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,750
but give me some time to figure it out.

319
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,280
And tell me the results

320
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,760
so that I know who's the liar!

321
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,310
Guys, I've caught several of those liars

322
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,820
pretending to be together
and acting in love in front of everyone.

323
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,240
It seems so fake.

324
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,020
Do you believe they're not a couple?

325
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,440
Do you?

326
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,170
Yeah.

327
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,640
You're so confident, huh?

328
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,570
I surely am.

329
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,800
I'm the best.

330
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,480
Hey, what's wrong?

331
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,560
Nothing.

332
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,680
Next up, it's light and shadows.

333
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,500
The play of light and shadows
adds depth to your images.

334
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:51,360
It's a technique commonly
used in iconic films

335
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,300
to create a more dimensional effect,

336
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,590
- allowing you to convey messages visually...
- Where have you been?

337
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,160
What's on your lips?

338
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,950
Mochi.

339
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:07,510
What?

340
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,240
I thought you hated dessert.

341
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,510
Piss off.

342
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,880
What's so funny?

343
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,160
Study hard, okay?

344
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,270
Is it fun taking notes?

345
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,620
You're smiling.

346
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,040
Professor,

347
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,160
Pawee has a question.

348
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,280
Fah, you asshole!

349
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,480
Yes? What's your question?

350
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,720
Nothing, Professor.

351
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,340
Teerak!

352
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,980
Here you are.

353
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,330
I'm going shopping with Dom

354
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,600
- and having a meal after...
- You're going shopping?

355
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,340
You two should go.

356
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,650
You don't get to spend time together often.

357
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,040
I'm going now. Bye.

358
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,640
Hey, you can join us.

359
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,640
I'm good.

360
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:30,880
- How will you...
- I can go home by myself.

361
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,440
I'm not wasting more of your time.
Have a nice date.

362
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,560
I gotta go now. Bye.

363
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,210
- Something's off with your brother.
- Yeah, what's the hurry?

364
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,120
- It can be just us two.
- Okay.

365
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,040
Muenfah!

366
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,980
Have you been waiting for a while?

367
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,410
Not at all!

368
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,690
Well...

369
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,530
Shall we get inside?

370
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,340
Um...

371
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,540
I think we should go somewhere else.

372
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,760
Where should we go?

373
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,300
Here?

374
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,360
Is this where we're gonna be talking?

375
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,780
Do you like it?

376
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,410
Yes.

377
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:48,630
I see.

378
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,280
You've literally thought it through.

379
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,480
Once we're in the middle of the pond,

380
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,570
no one can hear us, right?

381
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,750
That's right.

382
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,680
Shall we?

383
00:25:59,080 --> 00:25:59,870
Yes!

384
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,900
Should we start now?

385
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,460
Okay.

386
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,520
What do you mean, though?

387
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,640
That we're a couple...

388
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,720
I mean, that we're faking being a couple.

389
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,680
What should I do?

390
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,640
The first step to pretend we're together...

391
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,900
To make it seem real,
we must have each other's contact

392
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,650
so that it's easier for us to plan something.

393
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,720
What about the second step?

394
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,640
Well...

395
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,350
I still have no idea.

396
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,180
It's okay.

397
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,380
Take your time.

398
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,480
Have you told your friends, though?

399
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,160
I haven't told anyone.

400
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,510
Is something wrong?

401
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,710
I...

402
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,920
May just told me

403
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,640
that In from Civil Engineering
is dating Minnie from our faculty.

404
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,600
I'm sure they're not a couple.

405
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,480
I've caught several of those liars

406
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,360
faking being together.

407
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,640
And tell me the results.

408
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,150
I'm not sure if I should tell them.

409
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,780
How about this?

410
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,020
Let's wait until everything's settled,

411
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,880
and you can let them know after that.

412
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,920
Thanks.

413
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,860
We're in the same boat now,
so we must help each other.

414
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,400
I have an idea

415
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,840
to make our relationship seem real.

416
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,520
Let's take a picture.

417
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,910
Should it be just our hands?

418
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:52,780
It's what my friends do

419
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,480
when they're in a relationship.

420
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,800
Please excuse me.

421
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,530
Um...

422
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:12,740
I think...

423
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,370
We should be closer.

424
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,720
Okay, sure.

425
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,600
[Muenfah: Which one should I post?]

426
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:24,080
[Teerak: It's up to you.
Let's post it together at 8 P.M.]

427
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,790
Hi, guys!

428
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,150
- Ask him.
- You do it!

429
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:04,070
- Ask him!
- No, you do it!

430
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,680
- I told you to ask him.
- No, I can't.

431
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,340
You're curious about my Story?

432
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,710
- Yes!
- Yes!!

433
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,620
Well...

434
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,710
I'm just curious

435
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,990
and worried about you.

436
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,210
Yeah, why didn't you tell
us anything, Saggy Cheeks?

437
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,100
Right.

438
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,840
I didn't wanna keep it
a secret or anything, but...

439
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,600
it was sudden.

440
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,880
What do you mean?

441
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,030
Yeah, you suddenly made it public.

442
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,190
I was completely shocked.

443
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:32,180
When did you start dating him?

444
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,920
Yeah, when did you feel the spark?

445
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,080
It was that time, wasn't it?

446
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,180
- You know, when you ran into him.
- Hey,

447
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,690
will you let him speak for once?

448
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,010
So, when did you feel
the spark with my brother?

449
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,830
Well...

450
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,560
Just like Type said,
when I ran into him.

451
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,040
Knew it.

452
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,900
That means...

453
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,560
my brother's had feelings
for you all this time?

454
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,280
I see. That's why

455
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,680
that Scary Looker was so kind to you.

456
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,320
Isn't this just like one of
those romance dramas?

457
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,280
Aw, so sweet.

458
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,020
We're late!

459
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,400
Let's go to class.

460
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,020
Hey!

461
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,480
He's running away!

462
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,520
- Come on.
- We got nothing from him.

463
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,880
When did they start dating?

464
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,040
We're absolutely clueless.

465
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,920
Yeah, he told us nothing.

466
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,910
He usually tells us everything,

467
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,560
- You're right.
- but why did he not tell us about this?

468
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,640
Let's ask him.

469
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:56,790
What?

470
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,880
That's my question. What is this?

471
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,880
Your phone.

472
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,080
No!

473
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,600
I mean, what's going on?

474
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,400
When did it start,
and why do I know nothing?

475
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,400
He's right.

476
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,530
We've been seeing each other for a while

477
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,000
and just made it official.

478
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,760
Can you share all the details with us?

479
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,360
Yeah.

480
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,199
Fah,

481
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,400
is there anything you'd like to tell me?

482
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,840
[How to fake being a couple
when you're actually single]

483

00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,600
Why would you be so loud?

487
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,160
I dropped my jello, did you see?

488
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,510
I know the truth

489
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,560
that you and Muenfah
are pretending to be together.

490
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,320
Why didn't you ask me first?

491
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,600
You do know the truth?

492
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,940
Fah's told me everything.

493
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,640
Why didn't you tell me yourself?

494
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,600
I'm sorry, Babe.

495
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,920
I didn't mean to keep you out of this.

496
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,360
Stop doing that.

497
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,280
We really needed to do it, Babe.

498
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,730
What made you do this?
What was on your mind?

499
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,080
I think this will stop
Oh from bothering me

500
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,680

501

I've already made a deal with him.

502
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,730
I promise not to cause
any trouble for anyone

503
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,880
and won't keep this a secret for long.

504
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,480
Oh will probably leave me alone soon.

505

You need to help me, too.

506
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,560
I'd like to keep it to myself for now.

507
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,840
If Oh finds out, it'll get much worse.

508
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,300
Can you help me, Babe?

509
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,080
Help me, please.

510
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,520
- Please, Babe.
- Fine.

511
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,320
You're my only brother.

512
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,400
Of course, I'll help you.

513
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,390
Yay!

514
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,120
You surely are the kindest!

515
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,360
Oh, gosh!

516
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,050
- What were you reading?
- Hey!

517
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,300
- Nothing, Babe.
- Let me see. I saw something.

518
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,420
- Hey.
- Yeah?

519
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,920
Make a drink for me.

520
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,680
Jeez, you're doing nothing,

521
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,320
and you want a free drink?

522
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,940
Whatever.

523
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,160
That's all you'll get.

524
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,840
- This is it?
- Yeah.

525
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,240
Man.

526
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,130
Hey, Fah.

527
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,970
You're different
now that you have a boyfriend.

528
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,060
What do you mean?

529
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,400
You're always on your phone.

530
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,590
Exactly.

531
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,310
When did you guys start dating?

532
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,840
Right, and you never
posted a photo of him.

533
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,960
What kind of boyfriend is that?

534
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,180
I don't want anyone to mess with us.

535
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,730
This is too much, though.

536
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,800
No one would've
known if you didn't tell us.

537
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,360
Hey, where are you going?

538
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,720
Hey, Fah, hold on.

539
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,160
Hey!

540
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,550
He's getting weirder every day.

541
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,600
You think you're smooth, huh?

542
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,820
I've brought you guys
a dessert my mom made.

543
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,530
What a nice day.

544
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:11,800
Thank you, Teerak.

545
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,480
Are you having some, Lee?

546
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,040
Yeah,

547
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,790
I am.

548
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,020
Rak, who took you here?

549
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,120
Fah?

550
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,110
No.

551
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,830
I came with Babe.

552
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,320
I see.

553
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,440
Why?

554
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,780
Do you wanna get to know his boyfriend?

555
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,590
I actually do.

556
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,390
I've never talked to him before.

557
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,880
I wonder how madly in love

558
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,450
that cool guy is.

559
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:52,300
Do you wonder that, too?

560
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,420
I do.

561
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,290
Right?

562
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,010
Fah's my brother anyway,

563
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,700
and Rak's my best friend.

564
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,600
You should ask him to
join us for some dessert.

565
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,440
Sounds great.

566
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,560
Let's do it.

567
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,400
I don't think we should bother him.

568
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,760
How come it'll bother him?

569
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,040
He's your boyfriend.

570
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,200
Let's have some dessert, shall we?

571
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,030
Yeah.

572
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,120
I'm just in the mood for something sweet.

573
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,400
Ask him.

574
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,880
[Muenfah, my friends want you to
have some dessert with us this evening]

575
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,920
[Are you free?]

576
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,080
I don't think he'll be free...

577
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,640
[Muenfah: Okay]

578
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:51,190
He said okay.

579
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,130
Whoa.

580
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,960
How come he's so fine
just sitting there on his phone?

581
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,560
I thought he was in some kind of shoot.

582
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,240
He looks kinda like me, though.

583
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:20,920
What?

584
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:21,940
You're so bold.

585
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:22,780
I mean...

586
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,210
Muenfah.

587
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,630
Well...

588
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,840
I think my friends find it suspicious.

589
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,640
It's okay. Leave it to me.

590
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,160
Oh...

591
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,680
- Hello.
- Hello.

592
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,950
- He's totally a looker.
- I really want to look as fine as you.

593
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,180
Fah,

594
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,720
we're having some dessert,
you know that?

595
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,000
Yeah, Teerak's told me that.

596
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,840
Let's take my car.

597
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:01,880
- Yes!
- Okay!

598
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,080
What?

599
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,360
Yes, I saw it!

600
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,000
Go!

601
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,680
Come on.

602
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,040
I have my motorcycle.

603
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,080
I'll see you there.

604
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,200
I'm not coming with you. It's hot.

605
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,360
- Hurry!
- Ouch!

606
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,000
Let's go to Emsphere

607
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,270
so that we have many options.

608
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,770
What should we have?

609
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,760
I'm craving both bingsu and Pang Cha!

610
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,100
Is there anything you
want to have, Muenfah?

611
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,260
It's alright. You can choose anything.

612
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,400
Look, Type.

613
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,600
They're so sweet.

614
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,560
Yeah, I know.

615
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,190
Do you want to have dessert, though?

616
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,680
It's okay if you don't.

617
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,040
I do.

618
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,560
It's my treat today.

619
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,120
So...

620
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,200
Let's go to Pang Cha
at Emsphere, shall we?

621
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,000
Okay, sure.

622
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,180
Aw, it's your boyfriend's treat.

623
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,950
Rak, it's hot.

624
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:23,070
Can you turn down the temperature?

625
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,720
Okay.

626
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,580
Oh,

627
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,450
right here.

628
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,320
Thanks.

629
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,610
Let's get two of them

630
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,720
and share.

631
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,000
I want one Pang Cha.

632
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,120
I'm craving roti!

633
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,040
Stop fooling around.

634
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,200
As for the last one,
let's leave it to Muenfah and Teerak.

635
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,920
What should we order?

636
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,080
You can decide. I'm fine with anything.

637
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,680
What about this, Pang Ovaltine?

638
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,960
I see.

639
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,320
You prefer the milky taste, right?

640
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,160
Let's go for the Pang Nom Yen.

641
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,520
That's your favorite!

642
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,680
Joy, let's place our order.

643
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,640
Okay, let's go.

644
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,480
Come on!

645
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,600
Let's go.

646
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,300
It's your favorite, huh?

647
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,970
Enjoy.

648
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,680
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

649
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,640
Alright, that's it.

650
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:05,690
I'll begin now.

651
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,280
Won't you join us?

652
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,060
Do you want some, Muenfah?

653
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,060
Ah...

654
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,280
Is it good?

655
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,320
Eat up!

656
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,160
Good, isn't it?

657
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,570
Are you stuffed?

658
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,090
I am.

659
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:05,430
I know, right?

660
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:09,680
Thank you so much, Muenfah,
for treating us to Pang Cha.

661
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,670
No worries.

662
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,440
It's already 5 P.M.

663
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,360
I gotta go now before the traffic gets bad.

664
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,900
You're coming with me, Joy?

665
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,520
Right, I'll come with you.

666
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:19,520
Bye, guys.

667
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,560
- See you.
- See you.

668
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,860
- Goodbye.
- See you, Muenfah.

669
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,400
Are you going home, Lee?

670
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,600
Not yet.

671
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,600
I have something to talk to you

672
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:34,960
and Fah.

673
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,080
Let's find somewhere nice.

674
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,590
Before I ask you,
"Is there anything you're hiding?"

675
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,340
here's your chance to make a confession.

676
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,550
What confession?
We haven't told you any lies.

677
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,200
Rak, you're so fake.

678
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,760
I realized it as soon as you told me
you were a couple.

679
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,360
It didn't seem real?

680
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,080
Not at all.

681
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,640
Fah hates sweets

682
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,840
and that milky dessert you gave him.

683
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,520
If you're wondering what seems fake,
I'm telling you,

684
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,560
Everything.

685
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,520
Can you explain why you're
pretending to be a couple now?

686
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:33,830
- Kiss him!
- Kiss him.

687
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:35,520
- Kiss him.
- Kiss him!

688
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,280
- Kiss him!
- Kiss him!

689
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,040
Hey!

690
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:42,920
What's your problem?

691
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,200
He's my boyfriend.

692
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,600
Your boyfriend?

693
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,480
You think you can just
punch me and call it a day?

694
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,320
You're not a couple, are you?

695
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,080
He didn't lie.

696
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,200
Muenfah and I are really boyfriends.

697
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,200
That's how the story went.

698
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,990
We can't stop it now.

699
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,220
I don't want to cause him any trouble,

700
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,880
and...

701
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,720
I want Oh to leave us alone.

702
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,740
I'm sorry for lying to you.

703
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,910
Please don't be mad.

704
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,860
Please, Lee.

705
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,900
It was my idea.

706
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,200
Don't blame it on Teerak.

707
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,210
I'm not mad at you, Rak.

708
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,290
In fact, I didn't feel
like I was being tricked.

709
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,820
It was so fake, though.

710
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,280
Can you please not rub it in?

711
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,610
I'm serious.

712
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,720
You're a couple

713
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,320
but don't have any photos together.
No one will buy it.

714
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:57,880
Should we also tell
Joy and Type about this?

715
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:58,920
Stop it.

716
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,040
Those two can't keep any secrets,

717
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,200
and Oh won't stop messing with you.

718
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,150
You're doing this to keep
him away, aren't you?

719
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:11,750
What should we do, then?

720
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,600
Make it more believable.

721
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:15,030
How?

722
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,200
Lee, can you help us?

723
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,640
What will I get in return?

724
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:19,920
My love.

725
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,200
- Jeez.
- I'm your friend.

726
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,270
Fine, whatever.

727
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,230
First,

728
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,920
you should spend
more time talking with Fah

729
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,360
and getting to know each other better.

730
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,600
Having a deep talk, you know?

731
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,370
I think he's right.

732
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,570
My friends won't leave me alone either.

733
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,000
I know, right?

734
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,400
Before you have a deep talk,

735
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,100
take a photo first.

736
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,120
You know, like a couple photo.

737
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,470
We've already posted one.

738
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,320
That's not enough, Rak.

739
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,640
Take those couple photos
where you're really...

740
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,590
close and touching.

741
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,760
The romantic kind, you know?

742
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,170
Make it seem like we're in love.

743
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,040
Be close.

744
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,820
Let's give it a try.

745
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,400
Okay. Let's do it.

746
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,400
It doesn't seem like we're in love.

747
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,460
You're right.

748
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,700
Or...

749
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,730
should we get closer?

750
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,540
I have a task to shoot a time-lapse video.

751
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,640
My subject's a sunset.

752
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,560
Do you have a place to shoot it yet?

753
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:30,160
I have no idea which
rooftop has a beautiful view.

754
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:31,800
Do you want to go to my condo?

755
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,680
I like spending time with you.

756
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:39,160
Though this is our first serious conversation,

757
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,200
I find it...

758
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,000
comfortable.

759
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,230
I'm not good at expressing my feelings.

760
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,150
I was in a relationship,

761
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:52,360
but I've never been this close
to anyone before.

762
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,280
It's okay. Don't worry.

763
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,810
I'll teach you how to express your feelings

764
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,480
and show your love.

765
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,880
We have to make our relationship
look believable!
