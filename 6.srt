1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,860
There's Muenfah,

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,000
the Scary Looker

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,710
everyone warns me not to cross.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,440
Would you be my boyfriend?

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,790
- Kiss him!
- Kiss him.

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,590
- Kiss him.
- Kiss him!

7
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,320
- Kiss him!
- Kiss him!

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,240
- Kiss him!
- Kiss him.

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,560
Hey!

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,560
What's your problem?

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,650
Of course, it's my problem.

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,760
He's my boyfriend.

13
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,380
I think it's best

14
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,680
that we pretend to be together.

15
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,230
The first step to pretend we're together...

16
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,480
To make it seem real,
we must have each other's contact.

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,800
This can help create
a better understanding of each other.

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,680
Do you like spending time with me?

19
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,920
Couples have nicknames to call each other.

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,080
When you touch each other,

21
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,480
do it like you're a couple,

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,720
I'll call you "Fah."

23
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,280
What do you want to call me?

24
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,160
You Naughty Baby.

25
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,470
Let's go on a date, shall we?

26
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,350
Sure.

27
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,320
Choo-choo!

28
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,600
You look happy.

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,269
I am. I'm happy to go on a date with you.

30
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:07,680
Just the thought
of spending the whole day with my love

31
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,760
makes my heart race.

32
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,680
Are you not comfortable yet?

33
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,000
Then, from now on,

34
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,120
please allow me to touch you.

35
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,039
I just wanted us to be comfortable
with being intimate.

36
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,560
Babe, something's wrong with me.

37
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,509
My heart beats pretty fast.

38
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,120
Your next assignment is an MV production.

39
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,759
Since you guys are dating,

40
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,120
just be the main roles.

41
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,120
What's wrong? Why are you quiet?

42
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,200
I think I'm getting sick.

43
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,520
I care about you.

44

You feel overjoyed around that person.

Your iced cocoa always makes me happy.

52
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,200
You smile more often.

53
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,670
You tend to look at
that person without knowing it.

54
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,560
You have butterflies in your stomach
being around that person.

55

The closer and more caring that person is,
the more your heart skips a beat.

Goodnight, Naughty Baby.

57
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,600
There's a high probability that
you've fallen in love with that person.

58
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,100
Be honest: how's it gonna be?

59
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,090
You're acting strange

I...

61
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:09,760
What should I do
to hide my feelings from him?

62
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,930
I can't even bring myself
to look into his eyes.

63
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,200
You two are smiling again.

64
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,110
Hey, it's because Joy did it first.

65
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:26,620
Well, it was because I was over the moon.

Picturing you and Muenfah
looking into each other's eyes

67
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,290
makes me like...

68
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,920
I'm overjoyed.

69
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,400
Easy there,

70
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,790
or else you're gonna get swooned over them.

71
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,550
You're way too invested.

72
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,280
Alright.

73
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,480
You've been rehearsing for a while now,
would you like to take a break?

74
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,770
I'm still not that confident, though.

75
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,460
You should take a break.
You already got it, so don't worry.

76
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,360
I still think the delivery feels a bit stiff.

77
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,030
How?

78
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:02,390
The way you confessed your feelings
felt actually very genuine.

79
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,760
Mm... I think it's already okay.
Don't sweat it, Teerak.

80
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,470
No, I have to.

It's you guys' project.

82
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,550
If it turns out bad,
I'm going to feel really guilty about it.

83

Aww...

84
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:20,990

They're getting snacks and drinks.
They'll be here soon.

- We're back!

90

Type... Why are you in such a hurry?

91
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,050
- Alright, get yours.
- Thank you.

92
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,700
Come and take them.

93
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,800
Are you tired after rehearsing for hours?

94
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,170
No, I'm all good.

95
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,750
Here.

96
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,790

97

98
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,650
- I'm better now.
- Mm.

99
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,120
Well...

100
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,950
Shall we continue with the rehearsal?

101
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:12,980
I think there's no need for that.
You both look more like a couple than the play.

102
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,930
You should become a bartender with me.

103

Hello, hello.

You're here to pick up
Babe and Teerak, correct?

110
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,440
That's right.

111
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,410
- Please wait for just a little bit.
- Right.

112
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:00,210
You are Babe's friend, right?

113
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:00,960
Yes.

114
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,770
It's Muenfah. Can't you remember him, Dad?

115
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,450
- Oh, it's him? Long time no see.
- Right.

116
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:07,840
Where's your brother?

117
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,980
He's cuddling Mom.

118
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,040
Gosh, are you guys going to make it today?

119
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,060
Oh, they're here.

120
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,110
Are you going to be running late? Huh?

121
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,340
- Hello, Mother.
- Hi!

122
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,460
Please take care of Babe and Teerak, too.

123
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,740
One's stubborn, and the other's playful.

124
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:26,020
Dad! You're telling him like I'm still a kid.
I'm grown up now, and I can take care of myself.

125
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,120
Aww, you're such a grown-up, dear.

126
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,010
No, it's you in particular.

127
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,620
You're running late, so get going now.

128

129
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,730
Rak?

130
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:37,790
- What now?
- What?

131
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:38,630
Huh?

132
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,490
Have you forgotten something?

133
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,660
- What? I've already given you the money.
- No.

134
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,560
Have you kissed me on the head yet?

135
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,570
Gosh!

136
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,930
You're this old now,
and you're still asking me to do it?

137
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,580
Aren't you embarrassed by them?

138
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,240
Okay, I'll let you stick to
your cool-guy routine, Dad.

139
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,490
- Watch it!
- Ah!

140
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,420
- Mom, help me!
- You're asking for trouble.

141
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,320
Come here, dear.

142
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,010
- See? Honey...
- Alright...

143
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,490
They're running late.

144
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,140
Just let them go already.

145
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,540
- Take care of your brother.
- Thank you.

146
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,390
- We're off now. Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

147
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:13,650
- Be careful out there.
- Wait, let me have some of that, too!

148
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,000
Okay, but you're running late, dear!

149

151
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,900

- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye! See you!

Buckle your seat belts.

156
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,680
Took them so long.

157
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,210
Huh?

158
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,380
When did you get here, Teerak?

159
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,240
Ages ago.

160
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:59,040
- Where are we now?
- Go and ask the driver.

161
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,600
Why are you asking me?

162
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:04,780
Hey! Just stay in your seat!

163
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,980
- You're in the way; let's swap seats.
- No!

164
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,200
- Yes!
- No.

You enjoy going to beaches, right?

197
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,210
Yes, I really do.

198
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,190
It's so warm today, though.

00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:32,220
Yeah, I wonder how warm it really is.

Right this way.

What?

204
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,440
Are you the owner of the resort or something?

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,820
What's with you?
Can you not take a jab at me for a day?

No.

You're such big shots here.

Let's quickly put away our stuff

216
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,900
- so that we can start the shoot in the afternoon.
- Mm.

217
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,760
Can I be the one to assign the rooms?

218
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,940
- Hey, no!
- Hey, you can't!

219
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,520
I'll do it.

220
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,800
- I was too late.
- Step back.

221
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:18,400
Babe,

222
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,280
you're sharing a room with...

There goes Dom's hopes and dreams.

00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,060
- Sure.
- Here.

226
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,600
Huh? What about me?

227
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,850
You're sharing a room with me.

228
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:30,600
It's over.

229
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,290
- Why is that?
- I want to share a room with you.

230
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,310
Type is with us, too.

231
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,280
Oh...

232

We've got the big room, too.

233
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,510
- Right.
- Dom, you have to play with me, okay?

234
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,480
What? Why do you guys get the big one?

235
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,060
You two will get yours, too.

236
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,320
You're in the same room.

237
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,600
What's with this room assignment?

238
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,120
Man...

239
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:51,410
Alright...

240
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,680
- Gosh.
- That means there's one room left.

241
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,920
- Give me.
- Huh?

242
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,410
Brother.

243
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,500
You're sharing the room with Teerak.

Here.

245
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,210
Take it.

246
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,280
Hey, I don't think it's appropriate.

247
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,330
- Hey, Babe.
- How about we swap the rooms?

248
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,320
Why are you making such a big fuss?

249
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,360
Your brother's a grown-up.
Why are you so worried about him?

250
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,110
You're okay with this, right?

251
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:36,630
- Okay.
- Okay, then. Let's get going.

252
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,020
Quickly, guys. Let's go.

253
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,400
Okay, let's put our stuff away.

254
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,880
- What is it, Babe?
- What are you mumbling about?

255
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,880
- Hey!
- No...

256
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,600
Ow...

257
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:02,010
Fah, how do we share the bed?

258
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,040
I'll sleep on the bed,
and you sleep on the floor.

259
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,670
Huh?

260
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,550
You sleep on the bed,
and I'll sleep on the floor.

261
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,310
Huh?

262
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,040
How about we both sleep on the floor?

263
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,700
What?

264
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,890
I'm kidding.

265
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,520
How about

266
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,560
we both sleep on the bed?

267
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,120
Uh...

268
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,520
Let's do rock, paper, scissors.
The winner gets to pick a side first.

269
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,000
Mm, sure.

270
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,120
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

271
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,440
I lost.

272
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,110
You may choose your side first.

273
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,400
- It's fine. You can do it first.
- Well, sure.

274
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,600
Hey, Fah. Come lie on the bed.

275
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,079
- Fah, I think...
- What!?

276
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,079
Fah...

277
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,359
I'm alright.

278
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,800
How about we use pillows
as a divider?

279
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:18,819
Mm.

280
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,810
All done!

281
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:29,820
- Hey, Fah! The view looks stunning. Let's take photos.
- Mm.

282
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,360
Hey, quickly, Fah!

283
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:37,820
Hey...

284
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,020
Boo!

285
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,290
Let's take some pictures.

286
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,800
Let's get changed after taking photos.

287
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,530
Ah...

288
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,960
We're finally here!

289
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,240
Thanks.

290
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:13,980
- What?
- Apply it to me.

291
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,490
Here, apply it right here.

292
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,450
Here.

293
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,740
- Around my neck.
- Mm.

294
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,010
Apply some to this shoulder, too.

295
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,960
Enough.

296
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,720
What?

297
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,000
Hands under my shirt.

298
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,680
What am I doing?

299
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,120
Why do I have to apply it right there?
It's not exposed to the sun.

300
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,530
My turn.

301
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,040
Here.

302
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,360
No, I'm good.

303
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,060
Come here.

304
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,300
I was just joking.

305
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,800
Real!

306
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,560
Can you come a bit closer?

307
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,720
Let's take some selfies.

308
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,120
Sure.

309
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,030
Here.

310
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,440
This angle, too.

311
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,160
Fah, try listening to the sound of the waves

312
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,200
and see if they're similar to what I've said.

313
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,700
That they'd heal us?

314
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,840
Yes, now try closing your eyes.

315
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,440
Woosh and woosh.

316
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,880
Win, win!

317
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,810
See? I can be the crashing waves, too.

318
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,650
Woosh, woosh!

319
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,120
Win, win!

320
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,680
What is your favorite beach?

321
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,720
Here.

322
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,120
This is my favorite.

323
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,060
Whoa.

324
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,560
What?

325
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,560
Their arms are wrapping around each other, too.

326
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,240
Here.

327
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,640
- What's up with you?
- Wrap your arm around me, like they did.

328
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,920
Like they did?

329
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,960
- Why did you take them from me?
- Why? Come and get them.

330
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,510
Why? Why?

331
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,840
Aww, you can't reach them?

332
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,720
Where are you taking them to?

333
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,410
- Stop!
- I'm going to throw them. I swear that I will.

334
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,030
- Hey!
- What?

335
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,070
Well, come and get them.

336
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,640
Stop it!

337
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,600
Quickly, let's finish the work
before the light's gone.

338
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,400
Come on, come on!

339
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,360
Let's go, guys.

340
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,000
Come and gather around.

341
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,560
Come and check this out.

342
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,030
Let's form a circle.

343
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,800
Okay, this is where a break is.

344
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,270
Are you guys ready?

345
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,800
- Yes.
- Yeah.

346
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,340
- Stick to the blocking as we rehearsed, guys.
- Okay.

347
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,360
Dom, is the camera rolling?

348
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,800
Scene one, take one.

349
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,160
Action!

350
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,480
Be honest: how's it gonna be?

351
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,760
You're acting strange
because you're flustered, right?

352
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,640
Mm...

353
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,240
Well...

354
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,010
I don't know what to do

355
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:56,640
to hide my feelings from him.

356
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,720
I can't even bring myself
to look into his eyes.

357
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,280
Why do you have to do that?

358
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,960
Just tell him that you're flustered.

359
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,200
He seems to like you, too.

360
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,570
Aren't you guys just imagining it?

361
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,600
Imagining what?

362
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,080
We can tell
you guys have a heart for each other.

363
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,120
Mm.

364
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,730
Cut!

365
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,170
You nailed it in one take!

366
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,420
We'll film it from a different angle.

367
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,000
Well done!

368
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,800
Alright! Great job!

369
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,120
At least our leads' performances
aren't lackluster.

370
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,380
Our performances aren't just great;

371
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,280
they're real, natural, and outstanding,

372
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,840
as if they really did have feelings
for each other.

373
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,740
- Alright! Onto the next shot!
- Let's go!

374
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,320
Dom, ready?

375
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,600
Action!

376
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:50,680
♫It feels like the same old,
same old, familiar days♫

377
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:58,160
♫There's something
that makes my heart drift away♫

378

Whoa, this is gorgeous.

406
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,240
I'm so grateful for you finding me.

407
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:44,000
Without you, I'd have had a very rough time.

408
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,510
Without finding you,
I'd have had a very bad time as well.

409
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,840
Fah, there's something I'd like to tell you.

410
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,440
I'm sorry,

411
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,210
but...

412
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,120
I like you, Fah.

413
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,640
I'm sorry as well.

414
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,080
I'm sorry for
falling in love with you for so long,

415
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,720
and

416
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,520
I couldn't bring myself to confess it to you.

417
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,080
I like you, Teerak.

430
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,120
Okay, cut!

431
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,360
- That's a wrap!
- Okay, let's have dinner.

432
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,320
- Huh?
- Oh.

433
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,760
Why can't we have the actual fire?
We're on a beach after all.

434
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,000
Are you insane?
Look how hot it is in Thailand.

435
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,880
If we had a real fire burning here,
we'd be toasted.

436
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,920
By the way, you've actually got
quite great acting skills, Saggy Cheeks.

437
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,030
Yeah, agreed.

438
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:30,540
The way you played the scenes
felt so believable.

439
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,350
What was on your mind when you were acting?

440
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,080
Well, I thought about

441
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,360
Mm...

442
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,560
I thought about food.

443
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,760
- Huh?
- Huh?

444
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,360
Food?

445
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,200
- What food?
- Food? Seriously?

446
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,870
You want food?

447
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,320
I got this for you.

448
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,280
Gosh, I'm jealous!

449
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,160
Without doing anything,
you've got someone serving you food?

450
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,240
I wish it would happen to me too!

451
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,680
Oh, you do?

452
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,220
Here.

453
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,840
Gosh, I'm done with you guys.

454
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,920
I'm cooking this myself.

455
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,120
Let's go.

456
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,000
Here's yours.

457
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,980
Fah, come and try this.

458
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,760
Try it.

459
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,400
- You sure it's drinkable?
- Of course!

460
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,760
Trust my skill.

461
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,460
Is it good?

462
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,880
It's decent.

463
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:35,400
See? I told you
that I followed your recipe to a tee.

464
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:40,720
Being a business partner
but leaking our secret recipe,

465
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,050
shouldn't you get fired?

466
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,520
Whoa, what are you talking about?

467
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,760
We're all friends here.

468
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,040
Anyway, now that we're all here,

469
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,240
let's do something fun.

470
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,020
What is it?

471
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,560
Well, it's ghost stories.

472
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,790
Spooky ghosts.

473
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,920
No, that's scary.

474
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,180
Come on!

475
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,960
I'll tell the stories myself.

476
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,120
Have you ever heard of this one?

477
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:19,360
It's being spread by dorm students.

478
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:25,160
A boy heard strange sounds
coming from his drawer.

479
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,880
It was sometimes a thud.

480
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,600
Sometimes,
it was even a strange-sounding knock.

481
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:39,800
Suddenly,
a drawer was slowly opened by itself.

482
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,760
When the boy saw that,

483
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,900
he was in shock.

484
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:51,640
A fingerless pale hand
then slowly emerged from the drawer.

485
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,880
Its body was in light blue.

486
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,040
Then it sang...

487
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:03,240
- ♫An, An, An, tottemo daisuki♫
- Urgh.

488
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,280

489
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,680
What the hell was that?

490
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,719
Give my 5 minutes back.

491
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,880
Hia, that wasn't scary at all.

492
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,000
Let's hear mine. It's way scarier.

493
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,080
What joke is on your mind?

494
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,440
It's not a joke!

495
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,280
It's a real story, a scary one at that.

496
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,320
Let's hear it.

497
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:26,170
Well...

498
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,500
It happened when I was in high school.

499
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:33,969
We went on a family trip
to another province.

500
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,760
After dinner, Fah and I
were heading back to our room.

501
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,920
Fah took a shortcut.

502
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,360
However, it was off the beaten path.

503
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,560
It was the woods
on both sides of the track.

504
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,679
It was also very dark.
There were no streetlights at all.

505
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,040
Oh...

506
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,960
I felt like we were being watched.

507
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,680
So I grabbed Fah's hand.

508
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,800
Fah.

509
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,240
Fah!

510
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,350
- It...
- What's with you?

511
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,000
I feel like someone's watching us.

512
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,240
Quit horsing around.

513
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:13,140
- Argh!
- Ah!

514
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,160
So Fah and I sprinted back to our room,

515
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,010
hiding ourselves
under our blanket till dawn.

516
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:20,450
Then we had a cold when we woke up.

517
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,440
There's something
I'd like to tell you, though.

518
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,600
The story I told you guys

519
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,760
all happened here.

520
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,240
There is actually news about it.

521
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,200
- That's horrifying!
- Whoa.

522
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,120
You're quick.

523
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,600
- This exact place?
- Yeah, look.

524
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,680
Were you scared?

525
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,680
Uh...

526
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,430
I'm fine. I wasn't afraid.

527
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,600
Hia, you're done for tonight.

528
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,040
A sweet and charming guy like you,
I'm sure that boy wants to play with you.

529
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,160
So be careful tonight.

530
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,080
What? You guys are actually scared?

531
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Scared? Nobody was scared.

532
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,240
Ghosts are nonsense.

533
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,680
- Boo!
- Hey!

534
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,280
Screw you, Real!

535
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,960
- That was a good one.
- Aww...

536
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,240
I'm sorry.

537
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,200
Fah, was the story of you and Punlee true?

538
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,050
Um...

539
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,880
Why are you smiling?

540
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,120
Whoa!

541
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,760
Uh... Fah...

542
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,960
Are your hands okay?

543
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,640
I'm good. How about you?

544
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,720
I think my eyes played a trick on me.

545
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,560
It was just a towel and bathrobes.

546
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,880
You go and take a shower.

547
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,480
Don't be so stubborn, Naughty Baby.

548
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,320
Alright, I'm off to go shower now.

549
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,160
Mm.

550
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,960
- What is it?
- A fight broke out at the bar.

551
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,880
I've got the guards to escort them out,

552
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,440
- and they're now blacklisted.
- Are they university students?

553
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,400
No, sir. We've never seen them.

554
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,040
Can I go now?

555
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,360
No!

556
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,800
Why am I a friend with you?

557
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,720
Don't go and leave me, okay?

558
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,470
Leaving the door open
while showering is fine,

559
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,120
but you didn't roll down the blinds.

560
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,840
Well, I'm scared of ghosts.

561
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,400
Real!
[Muenfah: A fight broke out at the bar]

562
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,240
What?

563
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,070
Whoa!

564
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,160
What are you doing?

565
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,480
You didn't respond.

566
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,200
Why did you get out?

567
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,240
I'm already in my towel.

568
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,760
Just... Just get back.

569
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,400
Get back into the shower.

570
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,040
Go and shower!

571
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,320
Uh...

572
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,120
Are your hands hurting?

573
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,180
Was it because they were hit by me?

574
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,600
I'm alright now.

575
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,840
Says who?

576
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,680
It's obvious that they're hurt.

577
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,360
Here, let me help you.

578
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,480
Oh, your lips are pretty dry.

579
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,400
I'm just about
to apply my lip balm too, actually.

580
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,640
All done.

581
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,120
Thank you.

582
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,600
Oh, I'm feeling sleepy.

583
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,360
Should we hit the sack?

584
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,720
Mm.

585
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,320
Fah, don't turn the lights off just yet.

586
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,680
I'm not actually
afraid of this kind of stuff, but...

587
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,190
After Punlee told that story, I...

588
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,640
You're scared?

589
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,760
Mm. Sure.

590
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:30,640
We can leave the lights on.

591
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:31,810
Thank you.

592
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:22,920
Uh...

593
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,440
I'm scared.

594
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,780
I don't want to feel like I'm alone.

595
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,360
Can we get rid of the barrier?

596
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,320
Mm.

597
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,160
Now you know that

598
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,200
you're not alone anymore.

599
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:00,720
If you're scared, simply move closer to me.

600
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,440
Ah!

601
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,440
Teerak.

602
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,600
It's alright now.

603
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,200
Don't be scared.

604
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,160
I'm here.

605
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,960
By the way, you've actually got
quite great acting skills, Saggy Cheeks.

606
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Yeah, agreed.

607
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,760
The way you played the scenes
felt so believable.

608
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,840
What was on your mind when you were acting?

609
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:46,880
What should I do?

610
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,560
to hide my feelings from him?

611
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:52,960
I can't even bring myself
to look into his eyes.

612
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,520
I'm sorry.

613
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,000
I like you, Fah.

614
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,280
- I've already given you the money.
- No.

615
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:39,520
Have you kissed me on the head yet?

616
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,560
You're this old now,
and you're still asking me to do it?

617
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,320
You're sharing the room with Teerak.

618
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,680
Woosh and woosh.

619
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,200
Win, win!

620
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,320
I like you, Teerak.

621
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,360
Teerak.

622
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,160
May I ask if we can

623
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,640
do things like how a couple does?

624
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:28,680
Is that okay?

625
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,000
Uh...

626
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,760
I think you should pick up your phone first.

627
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,600
I'll be back.

628
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,120
The reason I didn't call the police

629
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:21,080
is that I want to see your face
when you realize you are being pounced on by me.

630
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,520
- Bastard!
- Fah!

631
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
That's enough!

632
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:29,860
I...

633
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,600
I'm a bit confused.

634
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,800
I don't know what I'm truly feeling.

635
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,080
Just say whatever you're feeling.

636
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:40,440
Simply do what your heart says.

637
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:41,650
Hello, Lee.

638
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:44,090
Dad got into an accident;
we have to fly to Hong Kong immediately.

639
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:47,660
Now I know that I really love Fah.

640
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,600
May I ask you to stop messing with me?

641
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,560
This is my request.
