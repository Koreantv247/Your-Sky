1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,020
Don't even try to trick me.

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,820
You haven't answered
any of my questions.

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,200
Why were you drunk?

4
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,440
Why did Muenfah take you here,

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,930
and why did he kiss you on the head?

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,820
I'm sorry about last night, too.

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,640
You know, for making you take me home.

8
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,760
I think it's best

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,080
that we pretend to be together.

10
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,680
That way, Oh will leave you alone

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,800
and stop messing with me.

12
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,160
It was so fake, though.

13
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,680
You're a couple

14
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,600
but don't have any photos together.
No one will buy it.

15
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,530
Take those couple photos
where you're really...

16
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,480
close and touching.

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,440
The romantic kind, you know?

18
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,670

Viewer discretion is advised]

20
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,440
Never thought I'd get
to see this side of yours.

21
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,520
Huh?

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,800
Are you hurt?

23
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,520
Are you okay?

24
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,280
I'm alright.

25
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,840
Sorry.

26
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,120
It's okay.

27
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,540
Why did your hand become weak
all of a sudden?

28
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,060
Well...

29
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,280
I'm not used to it.

30
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,600
You mean...

31
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,860
I'm not good at expressing my feelings.

32
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,540
I was in a relationship,

33
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,570
but I've never been this close
to anyone before.

34
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,680
You almost got hurt
because of me; I'm sorry.

35
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,030
It's okay. Don't worry.

36
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,570
I'll teach you how to express your feelings

37
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,430
and show your love.

38
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,630
We have to make our relationship
look believable!

39
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,690
Should we try again?

40
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,920
Mm.

41
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,260
I'll do it.

42
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,240
Uh...

43
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,580
Right here.

44
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,120
Okay.

45
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,280
Muenfah, can I use your phone
to send the photos to myself?

46
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,700
Okay, sure.

47
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,880
Thank you.

48
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,640
Let's post these photos, shall we?

49
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,440
Sure.

50
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,390
Which one do you like?

51
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,760
It's this one for me.

52
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,840
We can post the same photo.

53
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,230
You also like this one?

54
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,040
Okay, let's post the same photo,

55
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,080
and I'll tag you.

56
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,650
Okay.

57
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,460
About the deep talk Punlee suggested,

58
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,320
let's find some time to do it together.

59
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,040
Oh...

60
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,430
Wow, it's got so many likes.

61
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,720
Yeah, like hundreds.

62
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:01,680
[Teerak: Muenfah, our photo gained so many likes]

63
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,880
Hey, Saggy Cheeks.
You know what I'm thinking?

64
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,920
The dessert was so sweet.

65
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,470
You also have a video, don't you, Joy?

66
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,110
That's right.

67
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,630
I didn't think you guys were dating.

68
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:27,840
You guys were filming me and Muenfah?

69
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,820
Are you shy, Saggy Cheeks?

70
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,240
Well...

71
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,159
Yeah.

72
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,720
Why would you be?

73
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,920
When you were feeding him,

74
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,440
you weren't shy at all.

75
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,720
Well...

76
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,520
The views were nice.

77
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,270
They even went to take
some photos together after the dessert.

78
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,400
Gosh, you're so in love.

79
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,240
You're too happy now, Joy.

80
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,159
I can't help, though.

81
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,440
Most time-lapse videos are typically
recorded at 30 frames per second.

82
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,800
I'm giving you an assignment

83
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,110
to shoot a one-minute time-lapse video.

84
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,510
Your subjects will be
randomly assigned here.

85
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,850
Check out yours.

86
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,400
- Well, Tee...
- Right.

87
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,080
He only gave us 2 weeks.

88
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,290
How would that be enough?

89
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,720
- Teerak...
- It's better, though.

90
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,480
If Nim and the others
hadn't mentioned our workload,

91
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,400
he would've made
the next class the deadline.

92
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,920
- Teerak...
- How come there are only 3 subjects, though?

93
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,760
Morning, evening, and night.

94
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,920
A sunrise for the morning.

95
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,010
A sunset for the evening.

96
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,600
The night one is so easy.

97
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,720
They can just record car lights.
This is so unfair.

98
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,230
You think it's unfair 'cause you
got the morning one, don't you?

99
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,840
If you got the night one,
you wouldn't be complaining.

100
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,920
Let's swap, then.

101
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,360
No way. That won't happen.

102
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,360
Jeez, why did I get the morning one?

103
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,680
The professor said we could swap, though.

104
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,670
You can swap with someone.

105
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,040
Do you wanna swap, then?

106
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,640
Well, I really like my subject.

107
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,180
But if you want it...

108
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,330
That's okay.

109
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,240
Joy, let's do a swap.

110
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,840
That will never happen, bro.

111
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,920
The night one is perfect for me.

112
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,810
Why is this elevator so heavy?

113
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,800
Why is it taking so long?

114
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,920
Do you have any places in mind, Teerak?

115
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,270
Do you wanna do it at my condo?

116
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,940
It's got stunning, unobstructed views.

117
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,440
Well...

118
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,120
You're taking photos at my condo, okay?

119
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
We're good.

120
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,040
Go for it.

121
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,640
Teerak, have you eaten yet?

122
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,280
Not yet.

123
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,880
Let's have lunch together.

124
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,560
Okay.

125
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,990
- Hey, Oh.
- Hey.

126
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,360
Your condo's got stunning views, right?

127
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,760
- What floor is it on?
- Can I go there?

128
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,360
- Is your mom there? I wanna see her.
- Can I take photos there?

129
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,070
- What floor is your room?
- Please let me go there.

130
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,330
- Is your mom there? I'd like to meet her.
- Can I go to your condo?

131
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,100
- Come on.
- Please.

132
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,000
- Can all three of us go?
- Please, please.

133
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,920
- My condo...
- Oh, please.

134
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,350
I gotta go now.

135
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,630
- Oh, we...
- Hey.

136
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,870
- That was hilarious.
- Great job.

137
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,830
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

138
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,110
I just attended a photography class.

139
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,800
And were you going to
take photos at Oh's condo?

140
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,270
I have no idea how to tell him.

141
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:16,430
I didn't give him an answer, though.

142
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,080
It must be a beautiful view
from somewhere high, right?

143
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,640
Yes.

144
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,460
I have a task to shoot
a time-lapse video.

145
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,710
My subject's a sunset,

146
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,570
so I'm thinking of a rooftop
with a beautiful view.

147
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,790
Do you have a place to shoot it yet?

148
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,230
Well...

149
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,510
I have no idea
which rooftop has a beautiful view,

150
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,180
but I'll ask Babe.

151
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,010
I think there must be somewhere, right?

152
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,850
Do you want to go to my condo?

153
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,280
I mean, do you want
to shoot it at my condo?

154
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,080
Well, Babe and her friends
also did it at my condo.

155
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,880
The sunset was beautiful,

156
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,800
but it's fine if you have
somewhere else you wanna go.

157
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:03,820
Can I?

158
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,360
Can I do it at your condo?

159
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,600
Yes.

160
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,510
Thank you so much.

161
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,240
That's so kind of you!

162
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,130
You tired?

163
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,970
Yeah, I'm calling it a day.

164
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,120
Okay.

165
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,280
Your time is up, guys.

166
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,760
Get out.

167

Hey, how can you kick them out?

Hey, get out.

169

Everyone can play here.

Do you still want to practice?

177
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,120
We can do it at my house.

I'm heading to the club.

179

Jeez, I was having fun.

Let's just have a meal.

182

Deeper conversations

183
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,440

It was my hobby as a kid.

it says this can help create
a better understanding of each other.

It doesn't matter if
it's a deep talk or not.

236

What matters is that we get to talk

Beaches!

245

My family used to visit beaches often,

246

but ever since my dad became busy with work,
we hardly go anymore.

Right. Me, too.

256
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,010
The sound of the waves comforts me,

257
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,780

258

"You can do it."

259
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,640
That's why I love the sea.

go to where you wanna go,

267
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,010
or...

268
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,520

269
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,240
Shall we move on to the next question?

270
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,840
Coffee or cocoa?

271
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,560
Um...

272
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,040
Coffee.

273
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,040
You like cocoa, don't you?

274
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:00,970
Yes.

275
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,470
I love iced chocolate and cocoa.

276
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,810
It makes me happy.

277
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,440
When I'm stressed, a cup of cocoa

278
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,240
helps me feel better.

279
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,060
I see.

280
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,430
Whoa.

Day or night?

282
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,610
Hold on.

283
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,720
I'd like to change the rules.

284
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,600
Let's take guesses instead.

285
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,710
I'm guessing your answer,
and you're guessing mine.

286

00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,600
the night!

288
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,210
Wrong. I like the day.

289
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,480
- Seriously?
- Yes.

290
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,720
That's unbelievable.

291
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,510
I feel like it's longer than the night.

292
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,170
They're both 12 hours long, though.

293
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,580
I've started waking up early,

294
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,970
and it's made me realize

295

there's so much more to do

296
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,720
in a day.

297
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,520
You also like the day, right?

298
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,400
Wrong!

299
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,120
You like the night?

300
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,660
Just kidding.

301
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,640
I like the day more

302
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,450
because I'm sleepy at night.

303
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,560
Huh?

304
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,220
Actually,

305
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,720
I love seeing people. It's fun.

306
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,040
I like it when I go to class

307
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,290
and meet my friends.

308
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,360
Do you like spending time with me?

309

Of course, I do.

I like spending time with you.

312

Though this is
our first serious conversation,

313
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,420
I find it...

314
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,720
comfortable.

315
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,560
What are you doing?

316
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,640
Piss off. I'm working.

317
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,680
Where's Fah?

318
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,360
Take a look around.

319
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,240
Do you see him?

320
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,990
What a stupid question.

321
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,720
Hey, I totally forgot.

322
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,320
I was gonna suggest
that we go buy soccer cleats together.

323
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,530
No, I'm busy.

324
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,340
What?

325
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,900
I always join you
when you use the field at my house,

326
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,960
but you're not coming
with me to buy some cleats.

327
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,540
Can't you see that I'm working?

328
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,960
Well,

329
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,160
considering how much time
you spend working,

330
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,920
no surprise you're single.

331
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,360
Whoa.

332
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,400
So are you, asshole.

333
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,200
Whatever.

334
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,830
I'll wait until you finish.

335
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,280
Fine!

336
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,500
I'm coming with you.

337
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,440
- Look at you, jeez.
- Ouch!

338
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,280
You messed up my hair.

339
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,360
Fix it.

340
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,120
It's your hair; you do it.

341
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,320
Come on.

342
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,400
That's it.

343
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,400
Do I look good now?

344
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,270
Yeah.

345
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,400
Don't lean on me.

346
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,990
Don't do it! I can't do my work.

347
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,280
Luckily, we were done before the rain fell.

348
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:46,690
Thank you so much for taking me here.

349
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,400
That's okay.

350
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,210
Told you I'm willing to do it.

351
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,680
Let's have dinner before you leave.

352
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,960
Are you hungry?

353
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,640
Won't it be a burden to you?

354
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,640
Not at all. You don't have to feel bad.

355
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,380
Do you want to eat anything?

356
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,770
Um...

357
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,400
I can eat anything.

358
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,690
Just anything.

359
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,760
Wait for me right here, then.

360
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,790
I'll cook you some food.

361
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:10,680
Hold on.

362
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,200
You're gonna cook?

363
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,080
Yes.

364
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,040
I don't want to trouble you any further.

365
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,000
Let me...

366
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,200
cheer you up.

367
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,920
Let's go!

368
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,680
Thanks.

369
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,240
Whoa, this looks amazing!

370
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,520
Kaphrao with crispy pork belly, an omelet,

371
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,200
and cabbage soup with egg tofu.

372
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,700
They're my favorites.

373
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,900
How did you know that?

374
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,080
Well...

375
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,800
I made them 'cause they're my favorites.

376
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,680
- Really?
- Yes.

377
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,720
An omelet is perfect with ketchup!

378
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,950
Well, it's just my habit.

379
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,040
It makes the dish taste better, though.

380
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,920
You should give it a try.

381
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,600
Um... can you do it for me?

382
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,540
Well...

383
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,690
What would you like me to draw?

384
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,880
Anything you want to draw.

385
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,070
There you go.

386
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,590
What is it?

387
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,480
A cloud.

388
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,720
Thanks.

389
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,880
Let's dig in.

390
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,080
Whoa.

391
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,200
It's delicious!

392
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,920
Come on, give it a big bite.

393
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,910
Don't be afraid to mess it up.

394
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,120
I'll draw you a new one next time.

395
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,400
Thanks for letting me use
your condo to complete my task

396
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,240
and for cooking me a scrumptious meal.

397
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,180
If you like it, I can make you another one.
Sounds good?

398
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,610
Yes!

399
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,080
Your cooking is exceptional!

400
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,760
I'm not bothering you anymore.

401
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,800
Thank you.

402
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,160
Get home safely.

403
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,560
Text me when you're there.

404
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,120
Your hair's not stinky today.

405
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,090
Alright, guys.

406
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:25,810
Let's hear some updates from our friend

407
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:27,920
after going to his boyfriend's room.

408
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,240
What do you mean?

409
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,490
He was just there working.

410
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:34,040
Yeah, that's part of it,

411
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,120
but being alone together
is another thing.

412
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,680
- Right, Type?
- Yeah.

413
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,280
How did it go, Saggy Cheeks?

414
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,840
How aggressive was he?

415
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,680
Aw, I'm over the moon.

416
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,280
- I'm passing out!
- What?

417
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,440
He wasn't aggressive or scary at all.

418
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,960
And what else?

419
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,080
Keep going.

420
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,000
The views from his condo's rooftop
were breathtaking.

421
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,240
The sky was clear,
so my video was amazing.

422
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,200
That's it?

423
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,540
You only mentioned your work.

424
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,440
Right, he also cooked me dinner.

425
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,080
What's wrong with you guys?

426
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,720
Isn't it normal for couples?

427
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,280
Yeah, he's so kind.

428
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,080
You guys are so cute.

429
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,400
What's next? Anything else?

430
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,240
That's it?

431
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,280
Muenfah, will you be
at the soccer field today?

432
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,080
I have some snacks for you.

433
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,640
Yes, let's meet at the locker room.

434
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,440
Sure.

435
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,380
I'm in the locker room now.

436
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,150
Okay.

437
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,500
Your suggestion was amazing.

438
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,940
I know him better now.

439
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,040
That's good.

440
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,480
What's the hurry, though?

441
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,920
I want to thank him.

442
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,900
Oh, Teerak.

443
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,960
Are you here for me?

444
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,760
Why would he do that?

445
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,199
He's here for his boyfriend.

446
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,840
When will you stop being sarcastic?

447
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,239
It doesn't seem believable at all

448
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,520
that you're dating that Muenfah guy.

449
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,480
That's your problem.

450
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,489
I'm taking him to my brother.

451
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,650
Hold on.

452
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,880
I'm not finished.

453
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,000
Do you have anything to say?

454
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,280
I was hoping you'd come
to watch my soccer match.

455
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,440
I'm also the player this year.

456
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,800
My mom's been saying she missed you.

457
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,680
It's been some time
since you've seen her, hasn't it?

458
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,320
Hey, Fah.

459
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,200
What is this about?

460
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,320
Oh wanted me to watch his soccer match.

461
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:22,880
I see.

462
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,400
Is the conversation over?

463
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,480
If yes, we're having a meal next.

464
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,640
Yes, it's over.

465
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,200
Nothing else, Oh?

466
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,000
Are you coming
to cheer for me at the game?

467
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,390
If I'm the player,
he's gonna root for me.

468
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,410
But you're not, are you?

469
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,880
Who told you that?

470
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,400
Fine.

471
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,920
I'll see you on the match.

472
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,680
Excuse us, then.

473
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,020
Are you coming home tonight?

474
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,720
No, I'm staying at the condo.

475
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,280
I'm leaving, then.

476
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,680
- See you, Saggy Cheeks.
- See you.

477
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,050
Are you not going home?

478
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,280
Do you want a ride?

479
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,160
I'm going home soon.

480
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,080
Fah, can I ask you a question?

481
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,520
Yes.

482
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,140
Why are you playing this year?

483
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,880
I wasn't actually gonna play.

484
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,520
Because you've been busy lately, right?

485
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,170
No.

486
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,290
I just don't like myself as a player.

487
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,840
I told you I'm hot-tempered, remember?

488
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,080
Last year,

489
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,760
a player from the other team pissed me off,

490
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,280
and we ended up fighting.

491
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,660
That's why
I didn't want to play this year.

492
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,670
That's alright.

493
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,010
I understand.

494
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,890
I also have a lot of flaws.

495
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,480
My friends always tell me I'm too kind,

496
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,480
too considerate, can't say no,

497
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:32,770
put others first,
and forget about myself.

498
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,680
We all have flaws; I know that.

499
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,110
Yeah.

500
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:43,330
To solve your problem,
be honest about what you dislike,

501
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,240
deny it,

502
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,890
back it up with logic,

503
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:49,930
and express your true feelings.

504
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,200
And your problem should be solved.

505
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,400
Thank you, Fah.

506
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:02,440
I'll keep reminding myself of that.

507
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,630
As for your flaw,

508
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,800
I'll help you become more calm.

509
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,640
Gosh, I made the right choice.

510
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,870
What choice?

511
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,940
I mean, to be a player.

512
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,300
If I play this year,

513
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,320
it's gonna be the perfect opportunity

514
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,680
to show others that we're together.

515
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,080
Not only Oh,

516
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,080
but everyone from the faculty.

517
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,960
You know what? Oh just told me

518
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,760
that he didn't believe we were dating.

519
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,660
You've thought it through.

520
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,320
You told me you're not good
at showing love, didn't you?

521
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,000
I'm not,

522
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,320
but I'm learning it from you.

523
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,120
Okay.

524
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,280
I'll plan this out!

525
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,400
Come on.

526
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,000
Come in!

527
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,000
What are you doing?

528
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,870
I'm making cheer signs
to support Muenfah at his soccer game.

529
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:16,880
Oh...

530
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:21,400
This way, everyone will think we're dating,

531
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,040
including Oh.

532
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,840
Why don't you just write his full name
if you're gonna do that?

533
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,340
Couples have nicknames to call each other.

534
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,240
Nicknames?

535
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,880
What do you mean?

536
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,560
I'll list them out for you.

537
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,240
Write them down yourself.

538
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,400
Okay.

539
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,240
- First,
- "First."

540
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,200
you guys need to call each other
by cute nicknames.

541
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,670
Like...

542
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:02,930
honey, love, baby, darling, and so on.

543
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:08,140
So, what do you and Dom call each other?

544
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,520
Just "you" and "me."

545
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:12,040
Why is it so simple?

546
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,240
Well, if it's really special,
it can be anything.

547
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,240
I see. Got it.

548
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:21,480
You need to get more comfortable
with being touchy,

549
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,860
so it won't feel awkward in front of others.

550
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,740
How do I do that?

551
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Well...

552
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,960
Go on a date.

553
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,520
If you go on a date, you'll become closer.

554
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,460
When you touch each other,

555
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,840
do it like you're a couple,

556
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,080
not friends.

557
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,720
Holding hands, hugging, kissing...

558
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,900
Hold on.

559
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,720
Ignore the last one.

560
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,920
You're just pretending, right?

561
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,720
Cross that out.

562
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,930
- Okay.
- Alright.

563
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,900
Anything else?

564
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,640
Well, couples do have...

565
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,080
No, there's no need for you to do it.

566
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,000
That's all.

567
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,440
- Are you sure, Babe?
- Yes, that is all.

568
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,080
Okay.

569
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,580
Now read it to me.

570
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,490
- First?
- First,

571
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,610
we must call each other by nicknames,

572
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,320
like, honey, love, baby, and stuff.

573
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,240
- You can come up with it on your own.
- Okay.

574
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,160
Discuss it with Fah, you know.

575
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,320
Got it.

576
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:37,760
Last night, Babe and I
made a list of things couples do.

577
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,200
[How to pretend to be a couple:
1. Call each other by nicknames]

578
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,080
She told me couples call each other

579
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,110
by nicknames.

580
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,480
- Nicknames?
- Yes.

581
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,880
The names we use to call each other.

582
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,040
What do you want me to call you?

583
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,320
I'll also write it on the cheer signs
for your soccer game.

584
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,960
Do we need one?

585
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,560
Of course!

586
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,350
Trust me. I've looked into it.

587
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,120
Um...

588
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,200
What do you want to call me?

589
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,120
You Naughty Baby.

590
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,240
Am I naughty?

591
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,080
You're not.

592
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,160
I just think it's a lovely name.

593
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,880
So...

594
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:34,000
I'll call you...

595
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,450
Uh...

596
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,240
[For example, babe, love, baby, darling,
honey, daddy, mommy, or boo]

597
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,680
I'll call you "Fah."

598
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:50,970
Mm.

599
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,520
You can call me that.

600
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,080
Come on. More power.

601
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,000
Get lost. You're in my way.

602
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,800
Wow, practicing that much...

603
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,440
You scared of losing or something?

604
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:29,600
You need to stop 'cause I will practice.

605
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,030
Hey.

606
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,280
Hey, easy.

607
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,040
Better prepare yourself for the loss.

608
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,520
Fah, I have something to show you.

609
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,840
What is it?

610
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:24,280
Here.

611
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:28,520
[YOUR SKY: You can do it!]

612
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,280
Your cheer signs.

613
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,920
I made all of them myself.

614
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,320
Thanks.

615
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,520
No problem.

616
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,200
I have a surprise for you that day, too.

617
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,080
I'm going all out.

618
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,800
Look forward to it.

619
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,000
Sure, I'm looking forward to it.

620
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,360
Okay, please stay tuned.

621
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,040
Alright.

622
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,400
[You can do it!]

623
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,000
It'll give you a stitch!

624
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,240
Stop it.

625
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:15,640
Come on.

626
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:20,760
What is wrong with you?

627
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,520
My laces are loose.

628
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,720
- You want me to tie them?
- Yeah, 'cause you're in a hurry.

629
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,360
That's it.

630
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:15,920
Alright. It's time for a student soccer match.

631
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:22,040
This is a match between seniors and juniors.

632
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:27,320
The senior team is in yellow and white,

633
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:31,380
with the team name being "The Sun."

634
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:36,280
Meanwhile, the junior team is
in white and light blue,

635
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:40,240
matching its team name, "Your Sky."

636
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:45,160
The camera is currently focusing on
the player No. 8 of Your Sky.

637
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:49,440
According to the team arrangement,
his name is "Muenfah,"

638
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:53,120
and he is loved by all the fans.

639
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,600
He's handsome with a Korean look.

640
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,200
Let's see whether his skills

641
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:02,440
match his good looks.

642
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,480
Before the game starts, as a convention,

643
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:09,200
players have to greet
and give each other a handshake,

644
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,840
which is an act of
showing respect to your opponents.

645
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:15,040
Your Sky is the approaching team;

646
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:18,560
however, it seems like
there are mind games going on,

647
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,120
with each side intimidating each other.

648
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,450
It's time to do a coin flip
to choose sides.

649
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,040
Your Sky,

650
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,640
- the team in white and light blue,
- We choose this side.

651
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:29,360
Yes.

652
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,960
is the one
that gets to choose a side.

653
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,800
They're going to attack
the other team, approaching from the left.

654
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:38,090
Meanwhile, The Sun is
the team that gets to kick off.

655
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:47,640
There goes the whistle.

656
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,140
This is a game
between Your Sky and The Sun.

657
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,160
The Sun gets to kick off,

658
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,330
passing the ball across the field.

659
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,960
The ball has made it
in front of the goal.

660
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,640
They're trying to approach the penalty area.

661
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,680
However, Your Sky manages to fend off the attack.

662
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,980
Now, they're going on a quick retaliation.

663
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,360
- Fah.
- Fah!

664
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,000
- Now, let's look at Your Sky.
- Fah, to me!

665
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,640
- The ball is now in their control.
- Fah, in front of you!

666
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,400
- The ball got taken away from them too easily!
- There! Get the ball.

667
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,640
Muenfah has lost his focus.

668
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,800
His teammates called him,
but he didn't pass the ball.

669
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,440
As a result, the ball got taken from him.

670
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,520
The Sun has recovered the ball.

671
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,440
They're in the penalty area,

672
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,680
and they've scored a goal!

673
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,160
There it is.

674
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,480
The shot was true.

675
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,720
It's now 1-0.

676
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:42,080
The Sun is now in the lead.

677
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:46,200
That goal indeed hyped up all of the crowds.

678
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,360
It was scored by the team captain
wearing the No.1 jersey,

679
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:51,920
Oh.

680
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,240
Muenfah!

681
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,040
I'm here!

682
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,480
You can do it, Fah! Keep going!

683
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,120
You got this!
[You can do it, Muenfah!]

684
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:23,920
Give it your best shot!

685
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,320
You can do it!

686
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,160
Keep going!
[Fah, Teerak's boyfriend, is the best!]

687
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,520
Don't give up!
[Teerak loves Fah]

688
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,880
You got this, Fah!

689
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,160
Come on, Lee. Help us.

690
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,480
- You can do it!
- You got this.

691
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,200
Having a boyfriend does seem nice.

692
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,090
Let's go.

693
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:05,640
Now, all eyes are on Your Sky.

694
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:08,120
Muenfah has made it in the penalty area.

695
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,660
He's still going after being tackled.

696
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,890
It's the No. 8! Muenfah has scored a goal,

697
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,760
making it now 1-1.

698
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:18,180
Your Sky is now back in the game,

699
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:21,480
closing in on The Sun.

700
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,920
The Sun has switched up the pace.

701
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,200
It seems like they're riled up.

702
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,300
They're now going extremely offensive,

703
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,200
going for a one-two pass.

704
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:32,130
Now, the No. 1, Oh, is controlling the ball.

705
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,040
He goes for a long shot,

706
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,790
and there it is! A goal!

707
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,360
The Sun is, once again, in the lead.

708
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,100
It's now 2-1.

709
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,680
It may seems like
Your Sky was back in the game,

710
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:47,400
but The Sun has turned the table, taking the lead.

711
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,980
Did you see the problems?

712
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,730
You guys were all over the place
in the first half.

713
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,240
What is wrong with you?

714
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,000
Everyone's tired.

715
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:00,660
Real, Hia, are you alright?

716
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,800
You guys were so weak. Come on, press them!

717
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,050
Muenfah, focus and perform
like you did in practice.

718
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,200
Score some goals in the second half.

719
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,620
If you don't know how,

720
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:11,640
just pass me the ball.

721
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,540
Come on, we got this.

722
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,640
Your Sky!!

723
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,520
Score some goals!

724
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,490
It's now the second half.

725
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,160
It seems like
The Sun is still dominating,

726
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,800
from their possession of the ball
to their shooting opportunities.

727
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,240
At this moment...

728
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:37,000
- Oh! It's the star of Your Sky.
- Hey!

729
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,140
Muenfah got tackled,
falling into the ground.

730
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,600
Things are now heating up.

731
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,160
Neither team is giving an inch.

732
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,760
At this moment...

733
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,760
- Oh, there goes another player.
- Hey! What the fuck?

734
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,400
It's the No. 6 from Your Sky.

735
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,840
- He got tackled into the ground.
- Are you hurt?

736
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,200
His teammate has gotten angry.

737
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:55,960
Go!

738
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,960
- Ouch!
- Oh! There goes another player.

739
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,930
- Argh!!
- The player No. 10 from The Sun went for a tackle.

740
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,600
He sent the player No. 5 barreling on the ground.

741
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:06,480
The referee waved play on,
as the advantage rule applied.

742
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,670
The ball is in Your Sky's possession.

743
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,530
Can they make a tie here?

744
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,210
Muenfah did a one-two pass with his teammate

745
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,520
and slipped through the defense.

746
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,000
- Hey!
- He's in the goal area.

747
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,440
He got tackled,
falling into the ground.

748
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,640
Hey!

749
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:26,810
- Hey!
- Hey, hey...

750
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:27,640
- Hey!
- Easy, man!

751
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,600
- I told you I'm hot-tempered, remember?
- Hey, easy!

752
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,260
I just don't like myself as a player.

753
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:35,360
The player from the other team pissed me off.

754
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,320
That's why I didn't want to play this year.

755
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:41,720
Muenfah!

756
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,640
Calm down.

757
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:17,080
What will the referee say about this?

758
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,240
- The referee
- What the hell, ref?

759
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,280
- is holding a yellow card,
- I was kicking the ball!

760
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:21,840
- giving it to The Sun.
- But...

761
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,120
- Do we get a penalty kick?
- Yes, it's a penalty kick.

762
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,120
Your Sky receives a penalty shot,

763
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,800
which can make it a tie.

764
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:33,280
Whoa! This is a very important moment.

765
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,450
This goal is very crucial.

766
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,050
The one sealing the deal is the player No. 8,

767
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,780
Muenfah.

768
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,180
Will he score the goal?

769
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,370
This moment is very significant.

770
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:51,210
If they're back in the game,
they might be able to turn this game around.

771
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:57,320
All of the fans' eyes are on him.

772
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,040
Can Muenfah do it?

773
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:04,560
Can he make this 2-2?

774
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,500
He's taking a shot.

775
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,800
He's going for it!

776
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,080
And... A goal!

777
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:15,880
- There it is!
- Yay!!

778
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,120
Yeah!!

779
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,290
- One more! Let's go!
- That was Muenfah!

780
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,870
Oh, they're now back in the game.

781
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,750
Now, their moral has been raised.

782
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:29,150
Your Sky is attacking from the right.

783
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,840
The ball has been passed to the center,
then onto the left.

784
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,320
Whoa! No. 5 is taking a shot!

785
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,650
He missed!

786
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,520
Whoa, in this crucial moment...

787
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:39,000
Wait, it's not over.

788
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,160
Out of nowhere, Muenfah

789
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:44,120
went for another shot,

790
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,650
sending the ball right into the goal.

791
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:48,920
There it is!

792
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,930
Your Sky has scored a goal, taking a 3-2 lead.

793
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:56,690
That was a last-minute goal.

794
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,160
That means the game has come to an end.

795
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:03,920
Your Sky has won the match, with a score of 3-2.

796
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:21,720
Hey!

797
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,140
What?

798
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:24,870
I'll go first.

799
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:26,320
- What's with you?
- I have an itch all over my body!

800
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,960
I'm early. I'm going first.

801
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,460
- I'll go first!
- No!

802
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,040
Fine.

803
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,570
You sure?

804
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:39,410
Yeah.

805
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,560
Hurry up.

806
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:56,400
No!

807
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:01,930
Are you done?

808
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,120
No.

809
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,640
Come on!

810
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:10,640
Yeah, I know.

811
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:14,760
Fah!

812
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,200
Your boyfriend's here.

813
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
He was acting suspicious outside.

814
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,080
- Are you here for me?
- Yes.

815
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,360
I got you water, snacks, and a refreshing towel.

816
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,250
I want a lover all of a sudden.

817
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,720
He even brought you water.

818
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,160
Exactly.

819
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,920
We're single and free.

820
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:36,400
Right?

821
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,360
Yes, let's get some drinks.

822
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,760
- See you out there.
- Yeah.

823
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,910
- What's with you?
- You're taken now.

824
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,000
You did an amazing job today, Fah.

825
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,400
I was so excited for you to score the last goal,

826
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:00,120
but you absolutely pulled it off!

827
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,240
I had good motivation.

828
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:03,680
Because of my signs, right?

829
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,760
Actually, yes.

830
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,270
Do you want anything? You just won.

831
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,700
I can give you a reward.

832
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,280
What do you want to give me?

833
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,400
Uh...

834
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,120
anything you want.

835
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,280
I can give you anything.

836
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,480
Make sure it's not too expensive, though.

837
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,800
Let's go on a date, shall we?

838
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:07,320
The list I gave you...

839
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,200
You don't need to do every single one of them!

840
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:11,800
I've chosen all the popular places.

841
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:14,240
Are these where people wanna go?

842
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,160
Yes.

843
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,040
Do you wanna go somewhere else, too?

844
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:18,720
I'd rather go to somewhere you like.

845
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,150
Ah...

846
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,240
This may be cheesy, but I think you're grate.

847
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:26,960
I spent days doing my homework on it.
I really wanna do it.

848
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,840
You did a great job, Fah.

849
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,160
All of them were cute.

850
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:33,520
People say you're fearsome,

851
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:36,760
but after getting to know you,
you're actually soft

852
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,440
and very kind.

853
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,960
Are you saying you'll leave him alone now?

854
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,080
No.

855
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,840
I just have another way now.
