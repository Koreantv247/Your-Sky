3
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,960
Good morning!

4
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,580
Good morning, Teerak.

5
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,420
I've brought you a dessert today.

6
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,960
My mom made it herself.

7
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,400
Please give it a try.

8
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,040
Thank you, Teerak.

9
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,890
Here. Enjoy!

10
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:04,910
Here you go.

11
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,280
Thank you so much.

12
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,430
Did you place this order?

13
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,640
Here you go.

14
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,560
- Oh, how are you doing, dear?
- Hello, Auntie Lee.

15
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,220
Hi!

16
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,800
I have brought you a dessert today.

17
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,450
Really?

18
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:16,880
My mom made this herself, actually.

19
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,600
Oh, that's very kind of you.

20
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,170
- I have to get going now.
- Okay, dear.

21
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,360
- Bye-bye.
- See you! Bye-bye.

22
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,310
Please come again.

23
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,830
Hello, Nam!

24
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:27,800
- Oh, it's Teerak!
- Exactly.

25
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,640
I have a dessert for you.

26
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,200
My mom made it herself.

27
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,440
Thank you very much.

28
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,680
It looks so lovely.

29
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,600
You know what?
The name "Teerak" really is perfect for you.

30
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,600
Thank you so much.

31
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,920
- Okay.
- Bye-bye!

32
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,039
- See you.
- Bye-bye.

33
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,509
- Study hard, okay?
- Okay.

34
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,090
Teerak.

35
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,560
Why are you all alone?

36
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:48,960
Want a dessert?

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,280
My mom made it herself.

38
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,440
Teerak!

39
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,380
Jub! It's been a while, hasn't it?

40
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,420
That's all of them! Yay!

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,030
Aww, Song.

42
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,930
What are you doing here?

43
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,330
Do you want a treat?

44
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,560
Give me your paw.

45
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,560
Can you give me a paw?

46
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,329
Your left paw.

47
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,110
Sweetie.

48
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,079
Yay!

49
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,120
Can you give me the other paw, too?

50
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,760
Do you want to have this?

51
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,600
Ouch!

52
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,370
There's Muenfah,

53
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,980
the Scary Looker

54
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,140
everyone warns me not to cross.

55
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,550
A rumor says that...

56
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,150
Muenfah.

57
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,400
Please go on a date with me.

58
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:18,050
It's said that he tends to break everyone's hearts.

59
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,770
Not only that, but the title
"Scary Looker" isn't just for show.

60
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,780
He often leads his gang to fight others.

61
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:57,579
He's also so fearsome that everyone says

62
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,670
not to mess with him.

63
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,120
You really can't solve this simple issue?

64
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,100
My apologies, Mr. Muenfah.

65
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,600
Get out!!

66
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:09,830
Yes, sir!

67
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:22,940
I haven't seen it with my own eyes,
but rumors are just rumors, right?

68
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,410
If he were really that bad,
he would've already punched me by now.

69
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,630
So, he probably isn't that bad, is he?

70
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,480
I'm sorry.

71
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,210
I'll clean it up for you.

72
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,720
I'm so sorry.

73
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,800
Mm.

74
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,560
That's how it went.

75
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,080
I don't think he would get mad at me.

76
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,200
He wouldn't. It was nothing.

77
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,260
Don't think too much about it.

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,700
Yeah, there are rumors that explain how scary

79
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,760
and dangerous he is.

80
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,040
When I met him, however,

81
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,000
he looked like a kindhearted soul.

82
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,070
How did the story continue?

83
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,200
Was that really the end?

84
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,600
After saying, "Mm,"

85
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,560
he simply walked away.

86
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,780
There must be some truth to the rumors, right?

87
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,210
I think Muenfah's probably planning
to take you down.

88
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,280
Lee, you're his brother.

89
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,280
Is he really scary like everyone says he is,

90
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,960
and it's not just a rumor?

91
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,830
Guys, this is all nonsense.

92
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,080
If he's like what you guys think,

93
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,960
Saggy Cheeks would've been gone by now.

94
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,490
Yeah, he was worse.

95
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,010
Excuse me, can you give me the ball?

96
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,520
Sure!

97
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,640
Catch!

98
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,000
Hey!

99
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,120
I'm sorry.

100
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,080
I...

101
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,850
I didn't mean to do that.

102
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,680
My leg was doing its own thing.

103
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,040
I'm truly sorry.

104
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,040
Nothing is certain, right?

105
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,600
If Saggy Cheeks was gone,

106
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,780
then it'd be clear.

107
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,360
He was taken down!

108
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,900
After meeting him twice,

109
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,320
although he looks scary,

110
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,630
it's pretty strange.

111
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,840
Why didn't the coffee spill on me, too?

112
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,400
Maybe he saved me?

113
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,520
See? I told you that he's kindhearted!

114
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,880
Hello, guys.

115
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,250
Hello.

116
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,590
Hi.

117
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,360
Teerak.

118
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,480
Can I have a word with you?

119
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,280
Sure, what is it about, Oh?

120
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,720
We should discuss it over there, alright?

121
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,280
No problem.

122
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,120
Can I take Teerak with me for a moment?

123
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,010
I'll be back.

124
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,169
Saggy Cheeks never learns to say no, does he?

125
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,440
Does he ever say "no" to anybody?

126
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,450
Wait, why are you back here?

127
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,280
I spilled coffee on my shirt.

128
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,590
Fah, what's with your shirt?

129
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,320
He spilled his coffee on it.

130
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,400
Fah, of all people, spilled coffee on his shirt?

131
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,120
I don't think it's him.

132
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,960
If you say a clumsy boy ran into him,

133
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,800
I think it'd make more sense.

134
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,680
You're so good at making things up, Hia.

135
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,840
Why?

136
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,100
I wasn't saying random things.

137
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,500
Isn't that right, Fah?

138
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,480
These are presents from me, Teerak.

139
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,920
Why are you giving me these?

140
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,580
There's so much stuff.

141
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,820
I'm afraid I can't take it.

142
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,120
For you, these are nothing.

143
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,480
Please take these small gifts from me.

144
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,070
Thank you so much, Oh.

145
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,680
Saggy Cheeks, you're running late for your class.

146
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,580
Oh, you're right!

147
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,010
Please excuse us.

148
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,580
What's all this stuff?

149
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,970
I don't know.

150
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,570
Saggy Cheeks, what would you do without me?

151
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,770
What's with all this stuff?

152
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,480
It's the usual him.

153
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,070
He's too considerate

154
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,280
and never says no.

155
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,880
I already told Oh that I couldn't take it.

156
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,600
I knew it.

157
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,110
He wanted me to take it.

158
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,440
Saying no would break his heart.

159
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,460
You're always like this.

160
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,150
The professor isn't here yet?

161
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,030
You would've seen them by now if they were.

162
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,030
Saggy Cheeks, check this out.

163
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,760
[Muenfah in his jersey looks so handsome!]

164
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,260
How bad did you mess up Muenfah's shirt

165
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,010
that he had to get changed?

166
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,660
Whoa.

167
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,710
You should buy him a new shirt.

168
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,240
Come on, Type, that's too excessive.

169
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,960
Washing it for him should be enough.

170
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,480
It's not excessive.

171
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,630
Don't say that

172
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,420
Saggy Cheeks would go up to Muenfah and say,

173
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,840
Excuse me, I'd like to wash that shirt for you.

174
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,000
Would you dare do that?

175
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,240
- Lee!
- Huh?

176
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,100
Can you please help me?

177
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,760
Please?

178
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,680
Please help me.

179
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,400
How should I deal with it?

180
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,770
I don't know. Just hurry up and get it done, okay?

181
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,580
Hello, Fah.

182
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,320
Are you available for a call?

183
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,260
Mm. Is there a problem?

184
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,590
Yes, so...

185
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,430
It's my friend, Saggy...

186
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,570
Teerak messed up your shirt, didn't he?

187
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,800
Mm.

188
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,760
Yeah, he said he'd like to own up to you

189
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,050
by washing it for you.

190
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,770
Is that okay? Where are you?

191
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,400
No need. That's fine.

192
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,240
Is that so?

193
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,620
Tell your friend that there's no need for that.

194
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,720
If we want to get the shirt,

195
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,280
there are 2 conditions:

196
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,650
first, we have to make sure nobody sees us

197
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,360
taking it from his locker.

198
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,080
The second one?

199
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,120
We only have until 5 P.M.

200
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,120
The third one?

201
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,720
Gosh, were you even listening to me?

202
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,800
There were only 2.

203
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,720
Right...

204
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,240
To take Muenfah's shirt,

205
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,140
do we have to act this shady?

206
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,170
Of course.

207
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,000
Or do you want to let it be known that my brother

208
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,120
messed up his shirt
so badly that a junior had to wash it?

209
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,160
Yeah, Type, use more of your brainpower.

210
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,120
You and I are going to guard both entrances.

211
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,560
I'll watch over the left, and you'll be on the right.

212
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,000
If someone passes by,

213
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,160
call me right away, okay?

214
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,370
Okay.

215
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,600
I'll find Fah and his gang, and I'll buy you time.

216
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,080
You, get the shirt.

217
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,960
- Our mission starts now!
- Our mission starts now!!

218
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,800
Wait, aren't you supposed to buy us time?

219
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,840
No, I've checked the schedule; they're in a class.

220
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,370
Hey, I...

221
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,280
Last time, I scored 2 goals.

222
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,250
You know how to play soccer, Lee?

223
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,630
Where's Fah's locker?

224
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,840
I don't know! Just help me find it.

225
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,800
Well, why not?

226
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,360
I simply don't know. I can't call him either.

227
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,670
Why can't you?

228
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,160
What are you guys doing here?

229
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,720
Rak, I can't find the pen.

230
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,080
Huh?

231
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,400
The pen.

232
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,320
What pen?

233
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,170
We're looking for that pen, remember?

234
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,000
What pen?

235
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,180
That pen, remember?

236
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,440
We are looking for it.

237
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,750
We're here for the pen.

238
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,640
Huh?

239
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,760
The pen!

240
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,960
Excuse me, which one is Muenfah's locker?

241
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,760
I'm Fah's younger brother, you see.

242
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,600
He asked me to get him his pen.

243
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,360
Do you happen to know what his locker number is?

244
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,120
Oh, I think it's S508.

245
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,260
S508.

246
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,920
Thank you.

247
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,160
Have a good day.

248
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,240
Found it!

249
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:19,950
Let's go.

250
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,480
Are they here?

251
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,440
Did you get the shirt?

252
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,290
Here!

253
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,860
Hey! Others are going to see it.

254
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,000
Okay, to the laundromat.

255
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:32,880
Go!

256
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,040
Gosh, we're running again?

257
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,600
Excuse me, I'd like to use a quick laundry service.

258
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,640
What kind of clothes, dear?

259
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,329
There are no clothes that I can't wash.

260
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,599
Sorry, but this mess can't be washed
in a washing machine.

261
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,730
It can only be hand washed.

262
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,720
Okay, that will do.

263
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,680
I don't offer a handwashing service, however.

264
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,960
I can't get it done in time.

265
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,760
Please, this is really urgent.

266
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,869
Can you please help us?

267
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:30,510
I really cannot. I still have to iron the laundry

268
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,240
and deliver it to customers.

269
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,880
Please, beautiful sis.

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,170
Please.

Please...

Sister...

273
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,640
Please.

274
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,320
I'll do it myself.

275
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,830
Do you have the equipment for it?

276
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,640
You can do it at the front, dear.

quickly put the shirt back in the locker.

Are you okay?

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,600
What are you doing here?

340
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,400
You're looking for me?

341
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,120
Uh...

342
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,800
I came to the wrong room.

343
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,660
Please excuse me.

344
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,100
Hold on a second.

345
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,800
I have something to talk to you.

346
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,320
What is it, Oh?

347
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:14,080
I'd like to invite you
to my birthday party tomorrow.

348
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,450
You always come to my birthday party,

349
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,180
so aren't you going to come this year?

350
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,200
Well...

351
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,160
I promise you that if you're going there,

352
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,080
I'll stop messing with you

353
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,800
and will not make you feel uncomfortable.

354
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,050
Uh... Well...

355
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,320
By the way, what's that?

356
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,600
It's nothing.

357
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,320
Oh.

358
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,360
See you at your birthday party.

359
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:52,650
Right.

360
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,560
Are you leaving?

361
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,600
I want to use the toilet.

362
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,720
Sure, right this way.

363
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,550
- See you there.
- Right.

364
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,580
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye...

365
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,180
Don't you think Punlee
and his friends were acting a bit weird?

366
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,760
It seems like they were messing with us.

367
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,120
Yeah, I think Lee was acting a bit funny.

368
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,840
He said that his friend passed out.

369
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,080
When I saw Type fall over,

370
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,490
I was pretty shocked.

371
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,860
Wait, why is your shirt clean all of a sudden?

372
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,360
Just get changed.

373
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,220
Just practice and go home.

374
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,020
Right.

375
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,520
I think I nailed my part.

376
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,140
The mission was flawless.

377
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,710
I don't think someone like Muenfah would buy it.

378
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,800
At least the mission was a success.

379
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,940
It's a good thing that Rak managed to get out.

380
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,000
Honestly, I was very nervous.

381
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,920
Sorry for all the trouble.

382
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,760
It was nothing.

383
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,140
I ran a lot today. I think I'm going to lose some weight.

384
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:03,080
I'm happy for you! It helped you lose weight in a way.

385
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,120
Right.

386
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,080
Thank you so much.

387
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,190
By the way, what took you so long?

388
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,150
You'd been hiding for that long?

389
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,100
Uh...

390
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,640
Actually, I caught up with you guys late because...

391
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,240
I met Oh.

392
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,040
It's Oh again.

393
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,320
What is it this time?

394
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,160
He suspected nothing, right?

395
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,640
Yes, but...

396
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,600
He invited me to his birthday party.

397
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,780
- Huh!?
- Huh?

398
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,320
I even told him I accepted the invitation.

399
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,260
Oh...

400
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,070
You're not going to say no to someone like Oh?

401
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,300
He was going to take a look at the shirt.

402
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,870
What if he knew that it was Muenfah's?

403
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,410
Come on now,

404
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,450
who would think it was his?

405
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:52,810
Everyone would think it was yours.

406
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,080
Yeah.

407
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,640
I hastily said it.

408
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,260
Also,

409
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,160
his birthday parties have been fine,

410
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,520
so I promised him that I'd go.

411
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,130
Moreover, he said that if I go there this time,

412
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,120
he'll stop annoying me.

413
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,120
You actually believed him, Saggy Cheeks?

414
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,280
Mm. That's what he said.

415
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,350
- Gosh...
- It's fine.

416
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,520
Nothing we can do since you accepted it, right?

417
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,360
I'll be there with you.

418
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,640
I'll be the one taking care of you, protecting you.

419
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,640
Yeah, let's just all be there.

420
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,480
Let's help Rak.

421
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,420
Babe!

422
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,220
Oh, perfect timing, Rak.

423
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,600
I was just about to call you.

424
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:46,800
What's all this stuff?

425
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,030
Whoa.

426
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,600
Uh...

427
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,200
Oh gave me these.

428
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,750
You accepted Oh's gifts again?

429
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,470
Why didn't you just say no?

430
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,410
He thinks you're giving him the chance.

431
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,800
That's why he never stops annoying you.

432
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,320
Hey, easy.

433
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,440
I bet he didn't actually want to accept it.

434
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,060
You just didn't know how to say no, right?

435
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,160
I was worried it'd hurt his feelings.

436
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,200
I'm not giving him chances, Babe.

437
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,670
I just...

438
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,690
don't know how to say it.

439
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,830
It's okay. It is what it is.

440
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,480
Next time, I will not accept his gifts.

441
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,240
Okay, let's go home.

442
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,520
Would you like to drive?

443
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,330
He's spoiling you.

444
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,400
- What did you have? Your tummy looks full.
- You don't want to watch the film now?

445
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:08,840
He's lying on the couch now.

446
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,470
It's getting late, and you guys are still up?

447
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,300
Teerak and Babe, don't stay up late too much, okay?

448
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,090
Okay.

449
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,160
Please don't stay up late, Grandpa.

450
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,240
I'll hit the sack
after watching the film with these guys.

451
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,030
Right.

452
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,340
I'm off, then.

453
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,130
I'm going to bed!

454
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,400
Goodnight, Mom.

455
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,180
- Goodnight, dear.
- Goodnight.

456
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,780
Oh, hello, sweethearts!

457
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,750
- Hello!
- Hello!!

458
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,870
What treats did you get for us, Dad?

459
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,400
It's khanom khai from a popular place.

460
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,760
I attended a seminar today.

461
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,200
Did you guys have dinner?

462
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,250
Yes.

463
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,280
What about you? Do you want to have dinner now?

464
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,630
- Sure, I'm hungry.
- I'll reheat the dish for you.

465
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,880
Excellent!

466
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,000
Huh?

467
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,240
Why did you kiss her on the head?

468
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,200
Huh?

469
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,840
Do it for me, too!

470
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,600
No, your hair stinks.

471
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,920
What...

472
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,880
I'm not going to share this with you guys, then!

473
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,360
- Huh?
- Mom! Dad won't kiss me on the head!

474
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,110
He doesn't love me anymore.

475
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,520
- Aww, Rak's hair stinks!
- Hey!

476
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,780
Gosh, I'm so sleepy.

477
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,640
Professor Kae's class is always sleep-inducing.

478
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,760
Hey, Saggy Cheeks,

479
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,960
you're going to Oh's birthday party tonight, right?

480
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,960
I almost forgot.

481
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,320
Yes, but I haven't bought him any presents.

482
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,610
Guys.

483
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,200
Can you help me get one?

484
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,390
We're all going there,

485
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,850
so we each have to buy one anyway, right?

486
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,480
That's perfect.

487
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,800
Lee, please come with us.

488
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,640
Lee, please go.

489
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,880
Sure, sure!

490
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,480
- Let's go! Hurry!
- Let's go.

491
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,840
Do I really have to buy one, too?

492
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,040
I'm not sure.

493
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,990
When should we meet tomorrow?

494
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,920
Just a second, Dom.

495
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,680
Let me catch a bug first.

496
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,400
Where are you off to, Teerak?

497
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,510
Huh?

498
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,880
Babe.

499
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,200
I'm going to Oh's birthday party.

500
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,310
Huh?

501
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,840
Why do you have to go there?

502
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,040
I'll be back in a flash.

503
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,080
I'll take care of myself.

504
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,560
Punlee, Type, and Joy are going there, too.

505
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,280
Don't worry about me, Babe.

506
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,280
Please, Babe.

507
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,800
Please...

508
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,200
Please, Babe.

509
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,840
Please.

510
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,600
Fine.

511
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,520
Hey, hold on!

512
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,320
- Make sure you're not home too late.
- Right!

513
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,400
- Call me if there's a problem.
- Right.

514
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,200
- If you need me to pick you up, just call me.
- Sure.

515
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,240
You're good to go.

516
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:34,880
Hello?

517
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,920
The bug has been caught.

518
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,280
How are you guys? Please enjoy yourselves.

519
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,670
Teerak!

520
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,120
Hello, Oh.

521
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,490
This is a present from us.

522
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,080
You actually don't have to buy me a present.

523
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,480
Seeing you here already makes me so happy.

524
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,590
It has to be done!

525
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,000
I'm considerate of you.

526
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,270
Here.

527
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,560
My most precious present is

528
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,560
seeing you here.

529
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,360
Happy birthday, Oh.

530
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,400
Thank you.

531
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,100
Thank you...

532
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,240
You guys haven't had dinner, right?

533
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,600
Let's find ourselves a seat.

534
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,520
If you don't mind, we're off to find a seat.

535
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,560
No problem, I'll take you to one.

536
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:44,930
Right.

537
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,390
Hey, what's up?

538
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,560
Hey.

539
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,960
You guys can share seats with me if you like.

540
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,600
That's fine. We'll be over there.

541
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,200
Oh, Teerak, you can sit with me.

542
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,960
That's fine. This way.

543
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,440
Who gave you this present?

544
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,800
Teerak gave it to me.

545
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,080
You're making an announcement
of your boyfriend this time around?

546
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,120
Hey! Don't tease me just yet.

547
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,830
You're such a...

548
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,440
Your order has arrived.

549
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,250
Do you guys think it's going to work?

550
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,520
Of course!

551
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,110
I guess so.

552
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:55,949
Yeah.

553
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,680
I think...

554
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,870
something's off with Oh.

555
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,260
Wait...

556
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,660
When will Lee show up, though?

557
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,680
Why isn't he here yet?

558
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,200
If he ditches us, he's doomed.

559
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,600
I'll ask him.

560
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,080
Guys.

561
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,210
Huh?

562
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,130
He says he'll join us later.

563
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,760
He's helping someone involved in an accident.

564
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,960
Huh? Lee had an accident?

565
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,520
Is he alright?

566
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,860
Come on, guys! Listen to me.

567
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,230
He's helping someone involved in an accident.

568
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,970
Punlee didn't have an accident.

569
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,320
Right!

570
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,160
I see.

571
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,400
Now that Teerak comes to my birthday party,

572
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,440
how about we all have a drink, guys?

573
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,880
Here, I got these for you.

574
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,520
Teerak doesn't drink alcohol, Oh.

575
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,130
These are non-alcoholic!

576
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,370
I got you some mocktail shots.

577
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,200
You can drink all of these, Teerak.

578
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,290
It's true.

579
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,400
Right, guys?

580
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,840
Oh, yeah!

581
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,880
I watched the bartender
prepare these shots myself, too.

582
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,670
They're the signature drinks.

583
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,260
They're phenomenal. Try one.

584
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,190
Can we really trust them?

585
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,880
You try it; you said you want them.

586
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,920
If you guys don't believe us,

587
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,880
you guys can have a go first.

588
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,000
Hey...

589
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,360
Type.

590
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,560
Yeah, it's sweet

591
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,680
and non-alcoholic.

592
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,640
I'll try one, too.

593
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,620
- Go ahead.
- Try it.

594
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,640
Feel free to try them. They're non-alcoholic.

595
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,680
Mm...

596
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,280
They really are. You can drink them.

597
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,910
Teerak, would you like to try one?

598
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:19,550
Hey.

599
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,400
Try it.

600
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,270
Enjoy yourselves.

601
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,620
How is it? Is it good?

602
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:28,960
It is.

603
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,320
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

604
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,120
Cheers!

605
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,560
Are you okay?

606
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,000
Oh, you showed up just in time.

607
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,920
I have to go now.

608
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,120
I have a family matter to attend to.

609
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:25,800
Mm.

610
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,680
Also, for the outdoor area, I've changed
the reservation name from Mr. Naris to Oh's.

611
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,800
- How come?
- Oh pulled some strings.

612
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,900
So Mr. Naris allowed it.

613
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,800
The outdoor area is now reserved
for Oh's birthday party.

614
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,590
This is unacceptable.

615
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,680
Then why do we allow reservations
in the first place?

616
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,930
I've talked to Mr. Naris.

617
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,250
The answer I got was "So what?"

618
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,260
He has the power to do so.

619
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,560
So I said screw this.

620
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,120
I have to get going now.

621
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,280
Catch you later.

622
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,280
♫Happy birthday, happy birthday♫

623
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:15,320
♫Happy birthday to you♫

624
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,970
Thank you, everyone.

625
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,760
Thanks, guys.

626
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,930
Thank you, everyone!

627
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,150
Thank you, thank you.

628
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,260
Everyone! I have something to say.

629
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,050
Teerak,

630
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,840
would you be my boyfriend?

631
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,640
- Kiss him!
- Kiss him.

632
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,400
- Kiss him.
- Kiss him!

633
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,240
- Kiss him!
- Kiss him!

634
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,000
- Kiss him!
- Kiss him.

635
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,500
Kiss him!

636
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,450
Kiss him!

637
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,680
Hug him!

638
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,120
Yeah, kiss him.

639
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,400
Come on! Kiss him!

640
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,560
Kiss him!

641
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,400
Kiss!

642
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,220
Quickly!

643
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,480
Hey!

644
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,950
What's your problem?

645
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,270
Of course, it's my problem.

646
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,480
He's my boyfriend.

647
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,880
Your boyfriend?

648
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,430
- You bastard!
- Oh, easy!

649
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,450
- Oh, calm down!
- Oh! Relax!

650
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:30,360
- Fucking calm down?
- Easy, Oh!

651
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,030
Hey.

652
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:34,020
Are you not seeing this?

653
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:35,990
I think you need to calm down first.

654
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,640
Calm down for what?

655
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:39,780
Calm down.

656
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:41,870
Let's go back to our table.

657
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,200
Can I have your arm?

658
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,390
Huh?

659
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,480
Please give me your arm.

660
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,770
Please, can I have your arm?

661
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,180
Can you give me your arm, please?

662
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,720
Please give me your arm.

663
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,200
Can I have your arm, please?

664
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,140
Mm.

665
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,280
Give me a kiss on the head.

666
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,640
Kiss me on the head, please.

667
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:49,160
Please, give me a kiss on the head!

668
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,080
Please.

669
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,250
Give me a kiss on the head.

670
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,320
You no longer love me, right?

671
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,440
You didn't even kiss me on the head.

672
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,420
Teerak.

673
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,740
Oh is so mean

674
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,960
and rude!

675
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,420
You made me drunk.

676
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,490
I'm drunk.

677
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:10,830
Dad!

678
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,300
My head aches.

679
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,720
Can you give me a kiss on the head, Dad?

680
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:26,190
Mom! Dad won't kiss me on the head!

681
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,850
Dad only loves Babe.

682
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,040
He doesn't even kiss me on the head.

683
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,760
Kiss me on the head!

684
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,440
Kiss me on the head.

685
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,520
Please! Give me a kiss on the head.

686
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,920
Kiss me on the head!

687
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,440
Kiss me on the head!

688
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:51,960
Please.

689
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,040
Please?

690
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,800
Give me a kiss on the head.

691
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:19,680
I did.

692
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:21,560
Yay!

693
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,680
You finally kissed me on the head, Dad!

694
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:02,670
[Punlee: Saggy Cheeks, explain to me now]

695
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,840
[Type: Why did you let him
kiss you on your head, Saggy Cheeks!?]

696
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,160
[Babe: We need to talk! Now!]

697
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,600
[Joy: Wait, with Muenfah? Spill it!]

698
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,040
[Dom: Babe is really mad now, Teerak]

699
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,430
[Punlee: How come Muenfah kissed you on the head?]
[Type: With Muenfah?]

700
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,880
[Joy: You're in a relationship? Why didn't you tell me?]
[Dom: Get up and answer Babe, Teerak]

701
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:50,040
No!!

702
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,850
Fah, is there anything you'd like to tell me?

703
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,840
So, what is it then?

704
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,000
What does it have to do with Muenfah?

705
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,000
I'm all confused.

706
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,680
I don't even know what to be shocked by first.

707
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:18,890
Do you know that you've caused trouble again?

708
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,760
I've never seen you talk to anybody,

709
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,600
so how could you be dating Muenfah?

710
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,000
Muenfah and I

711
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,640
really are boyfriends.

712
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,480
That's what Oh believed, anyway.

713
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,760
I think it's best that we pretend to be together.

714
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,880
Yes, I agree to pretend we're a couple.

715
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,400
I have something to talk to you

716
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:35,880
and Fah.

717
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,100
Before I ask you, "Is there anything you're hiding?"

718
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,800
here's your chance to make a confession.

719
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,840
What confession? We haven't told you any lies.
