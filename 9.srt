1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,320
Oh already stopped approaching me.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,840
I won't bother you anymore.

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,520
Thank you for everything you've done for me.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,840
I'm fine with you...

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,880
ending this fake relationship.

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,920
Let's build a real one together.

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,960
I told Babe about us.

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,820
However, I haven't told my parents
and my grandpa.

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,280
I don't know what they'd think of this.

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,670
Teerak, don't overthink.

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,280
Humans can make a long distance

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,160
way shorter.

13
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,240
Like this.

14
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,120
Why? Your heart's fluttering?

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,440
How about this now?

16
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,450
What do you feel when I do this to you?

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,920
May I...

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,290
I'm just excited.

19
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,520
It's alright.

20
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,530
I can wait.

21

23
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,920
Don't open your eyes just yet.

24
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,960
I won't. What are you trying to do?

25
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,800
- I've got a surprise for you.
- A surprise this late?

26
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,000
And why do you need to cover my eyes?

27
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,880
Come on. Just keep walking.

28
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,120
- Careful.
- Walk...

29
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,720
We're almost there.

30
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,240
Alright, stop here.

31
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,720
- Keep your eyes closed.
- Okay. Got it.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,200
Count to three and open your eyes.

33
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,100
1, 2, 3...

34
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,079
Here.

35
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,880
Ta-da!

36
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,120
Whose puppy is that?

37
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,190
I adopted him from a shelter.

38
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,310
I wanted him to be a surprise gift
for our anniversary.

39
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,320
You like him?

40
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,030
Dom,

41
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,310
this is not a good surprise.

42
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,070
It's a big deal, you know that?

43
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,110
You can't decide this on your own.

44
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,750
Why didn't you discuss it with me first?

45
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,829
- I mean...
- What if we can't take care of him properly?

46
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,470
How will you deal with that?

47
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,070
We should adopt him when we're ready, Dom.

48
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,260
Babe! Dom!

49
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,920
What are you talking about?

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,960
Aw, a puppy!

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,400
Where did you get him?

52
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,640
Can I play with him?

53
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,840
Dom, just take him back.

54
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,320
My dad won't let us have him.

55
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,280
You're giving him to us?

56
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,960
He's so adorable,

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,040
but I'm sure Dad won't let us have him.

58
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,880
Aww, baby.

59
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,520
Who told you I wouldn't?

60
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,280
Hey,

61
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,840
Dom already asked for my permission ages ago.

62
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,640
Oh!

63
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,560
Hi, Dad.

64
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,130
Come on.

65
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,440
Why would you be so surprised?

66
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,240
Why are you here so early? What is it?

67
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,440
I have something to discuss with you.

68
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,240
Sure. Have a seat.

69
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,560
Uh...

70
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,159
I want to give Babe an anniversary surprise,

71
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,720
but I'm not sure if you'll be okay with it.

72
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,159
What's the surprise?

73
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,640
I'm gonna adopt a puppy.

74
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,240
Well...

75
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,560
I know this might be tough on Babe,

76
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,000
but I promise to handle it with her
as best as I can.

77
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,620
As for the costs of raising the puppy,

78
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,840
I'll cover them.

79
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,640
Well,

80
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,760
I'm fine with that

81
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,960
cause Babe and Rak are both dog lovers.

82
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,720
If they get one, they'll take good care of it.

83
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,710
That's alright.

84
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,520
- Thank you so much, Dad.
- Okay.

85
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,520
You can give it a name, then.

86
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,880
Let Babe do it.

87
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,880
I already talked to your dad before this

88
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,660
cause I wanted this to be
an anniversary surprise for you.

89
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,480
I'm the one getting surprised, though.

90
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,200
Who would've known that?

91
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,880
So that means...

92
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,900
we can have him?

93
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,040
Yes, dear.

94
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,600
You have to take good care of him, though.

95
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,440
As for the costs,

96
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,280
whether it be his food or medical treatment,

97
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,120
I'll cover them all.

98
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,560
Yay!

99
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,880
I really, really want to have him!

100
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,720
Can I hold him, please?

101
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,760
Here you go.

102
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,080
You almost didn't make it, you know that?

103
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:15,080
You owe my dad for letting you stay.

104
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,320
- Thanks, Dad.
- It's okay.

105
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,380
Thanks, Dom.

106
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,600
I was really surprised.

107
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,440
He's very cute.

108
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,780
Thank you, Dom.

109
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,840
I really want to raise a puppy.

110
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,280
Gosh, who's the real owner now?

111
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,800
If you don't want him,
I can take care of him for you.

"Yes."

114
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,080
Can I name him, Babe?

115
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,159
Sure.

116
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,680
Let's call him...

117
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,040
"Mookrob."

118
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,530
Whoa.

119
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,980
Who do you belong to, huh?

120
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,920
- Fine, let's call you Mookrob.
- Mookrob.

00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,800
So cute!

125
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,760
- Thank you.
- How can you sleep?

126
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,840
Give me a kiss.

127
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,590
You were so harsh.

128
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,400
This is your brother, Mookrob.

129
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,760
What should we name him?

130
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,420
Moowan?

131
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,630
Mookem?

132
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,360
Or...

133
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,980
Mooping or Mooyang?

134
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,040
If he talks back, I'll run away from this.

135
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,790
Hi, Mookrob.

136
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,360
I am...

137
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,520
Um...

138
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,420
What should we name him, Babe?

139
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,960
Just give him a name. Anything is fine.

140
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,190
Babe, smile!

I didn't think you would bring me here twice.

172
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,840
Do you like it?

173
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,880
Of course, I do.

174
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,360
I like desserts the most!

175
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,550
Mm!

176
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,600
This is fantastic.

177
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,800
Mm...

178
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,880
It's not too sweet for you, is it?

179
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,760
I'm glad you like it.

180
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,160
I like everything my boyfriend likes.

181
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,320
Come on!

182
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,480
You always make me blush.

183
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,390
What are you buying for your room?
I'll help you find them.

184
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,880
Um...

185
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,760
Soap and shampoo.

186
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,840
Fah,

187
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,600
do you wanna try GO HAIR shampoo?

188
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,120
My family also uses it.

189
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,800
It makes your hair soft and silky,

190
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,720
and it's totally safe for sensitive skin.

191
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,440
Um...

192
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,880
Okay, sure.

193
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,800
Are you okay?

194
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,680
I put on the wrong socks.

195
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,280
These are too thin,
so the shoes hurt my feet.

196
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,560
I'm fine, though. It's nothing.

197
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,760
What are you gonna do?

198
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,200
Let's swap our shoes.

199
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,800
I'm good.

200
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,400
Well...

201
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,240
Let's get a new pair, then.

202
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,760
Can we have comfortable shoes in size 43

203
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,480
and a pair of socks, please?

204
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,880
Sure, sir.

205
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,800
Do they hurt very badly?

206
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,440
Well...

207
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,120
Not really.

208
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,160
These are the comfortable shoes, sir.

209
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,400
They're the best sellers.

210
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,560
The soles will adapt to the shape of your feet.

211
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,600
Let me know if they hurt your feet

212
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:40,320
or if you want to try more shoes.

213
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,160
Okay.

214
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,400
You can walk around, sir.

215
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,080
They're so comfy.

216
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,920
- We're buying these.
- Sure.

217
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,560
Are you going to wear them now?

218
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,520
Yes.

219
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,720
You like them?

220
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,760
Should I get them for you?

221
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,000
Oh, I'm good.

222
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,600
This pair is enough.

223
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,720
I don't want to bother you.

224
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,800
I'm willing to do it for my boyfriend, though.

225
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,840
No need to do that.

226
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,600
Can I have a hug instead?

227
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,760
- You like them?
- Yeah.

228
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,530
Hello?

229
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,070
What's wrong with you?

230
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,560
He started it,

231
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,320
but he's avoiding me 'cause I did it back.

232
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,520
You know,

233
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,640
he's not even showing up to care for me.

234
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,250
This sucks.

235
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,040
You're talking about Hia?

236
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,360
Yeah.

237
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,280
Be honest with me.

238
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,080
How did this fight start?

239
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,600
I don't know.

240
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,080
You don't?

241
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,680
But you seem upset when he's not around.

242
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,080
You both should talk it out.

243
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,720
Be honest with yourself

244
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,640
and your feelings for him.

245
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
What do you mean?

246
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,560
You know what I'm talking about.

247
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,900
You're here? I'm cooking.

248
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,080
Nice. I'll help you, then.

249
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:55,920
Okay.

250
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,600
Are you not answering that?

251
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,640
I don't think it's important.

252
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:06,710
You should pick it up.

253
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,400
I'll chop the veggies in the meantime.

254
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,560
Thanks.

255
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,520
What is it?

256
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,440
Are you free to talk?

257
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,960
I want your help with something.

258
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,599
What is it?

259
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,119
It's not about me.

260
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,760
I mean... It's what my friend asked me.

261
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,359
I don't know how to help him,

262
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,400
so I want your opinions.

263
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,080
Okay.

264
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,940
Here's what it is.

265
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,330
My friend and his close friend

266
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,800
kinda did something...

267
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,480
Uh...

268
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,770
What?

269
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,040
Something odd.

270
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,560
Things have become awkward between them.

271
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,080
What should he do?

272
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,280
What do you mean by "something odd"?

273
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,900
This is you and Real, right?

274
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,540
No, it's not.

275
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,000
It's nothing.

276
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,240
Did you tell him you're sorry?

277
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,870
Friends can talk everything out.

278
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,960
A little bit?

279
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,920
Yes.

280
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,160
You're right.

281
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,280
Teerak,

282
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,360
that's sugar, not salt.

283
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,800
Are you with Teerak?

284
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,600
Yeah.

285
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,560
I gotta go.

286
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,840
I'll do it for you.

287
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,200
Okay.

288
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,600
You're amazing!

289
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,200
- I'll set up the dishes, then.
- Umm.

290
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,960
Um...

291
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,880
This one.

292
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,200
Don't call him.

293
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,920
Call...

294
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,960
Don't call him.

295
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,970
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

296
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,840
Another glass of neat spirit, please.

297
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,960
Sure, sir.

298
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,280
Here you are, sir.

299
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,040
I'm not calling you, Real!

300
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,200
Teerak,

301
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,640
let's go to bed.

302
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,080
Hello.

303
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,900
Hey, Fah,

304
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,190
is Rak with you?

305
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,720
Yeah, he's sleeping.

306
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,480
That's why he didn't pick up my calls.

307
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I'll take him home when he wakes up.

308
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,360
Don't worry.

309
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,860
It's already late, though.

310
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,500
I actually called to tell him that
he could stay at your place.

311
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,240
Can he?

312
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,000
Don't ask me too much,
or I'll change my mind.

313
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,040
Got it.

314
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,230
Yeah?

315
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:57,740
Hey, Hia.

316
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,540
Why are you not speaking?

317
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,380
Hey.

318
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,840
Hello.

319
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,360
Who are you?

320
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,480
I'm a bartender at Pae's bar.

321
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,880
Please take your friend home.
He's very drunk

322
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,920
and asleep here.

323
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,520
Watch him for me. I'm coming.

324
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,040
Gosh, Dad's gonna be mad at me.

325
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,280
Will Mom punish me?
What about Babe?

326
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,720
Fah, what should I do?
My family's gonna be mad.

327
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,280
Babe and I already talked.

328
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,560
She said...

329
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,840
you could spend the night here.

330
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,280
- Really?
- Yes.

331
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,440
Do you wanna go to bed now
or take a shower first?

332
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,850
I think I'll go take a shower.

333
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,000
I was shocked, and it made me awake.

334
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,420
Well...

335
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,280
Can you wear my pajamas instead?

336
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,360
Sure. Thanks, Fah.

337
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,640
Hey, Hia.

338
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,200
Are you here by yourself?

339
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,820
- Whoa.
- Who is this?

340
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,680
Hey, it's me, Pae.

341
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,300
You're very drunk.

342
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,130
Do you want a ride?

343
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,520
Come with me, will you?

344
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,440
Hey, what are you trying to do?

345
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,320
Nothing.

346
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,720
Well, Hia...

347
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,560
Why didn't you tell me you're with someone?

348
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,960
Just take your friend home safely.

349
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,480
Jeez, Hia.

350
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,280
Get up!

351
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,780
- Who is this again?
- It's me!

352
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,880
What? I'm not leaving.

353
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,120
- I want more drinks.
- Don't make me repeat myself.

354
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,160
Hey! Come on!

355
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,280
I'm not leaving.

356
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,600
I want more drinks!

357
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,080
This smells like Fah.

358
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,640
It's not my first time sharing a bed with him,

359
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,920
but why am I so nervous?

360
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,800
Is something wrong?

361
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,890
I'm feeling sleepy all of a sudden.

362
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:45,930
I'll go to sleep now.

363
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,020
Good night, Fah.

364
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,520
Have a good night.

365
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,270
Gosh.

366
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,400
Hey, what are you doing?

367
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,240
What? It's my house.
I can do anything.

368
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,460
Stop it right there!

369
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,080
- Stop it.
- What?

370
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,440
Come on! What is wrong with you?

371
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,600
What? You're not leaving?

372
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,520
This is my place.

373
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,680
How did I get here?

374
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,240
You kidnapped me?

375
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,640
You had the audacity
to get drunk at my rival's bar,

376
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,560
but what if something happened to you?

377
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,720
- Why would you stick your nose into this?
- I was worried about you!

378
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,840
Stop playing with my feelings!

379
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,040
- You're the reason I'm like this!
- I'm not!

380
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,960
I'm not, and I never was!

381
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,200
Fine! It's my fault.

382
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,280
I'm sorry.

383
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,440
If you want me to stay out of this...

384
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,760
I won't bother you anymore.

385
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,200
Wait.

386
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,960
Stay here for tonight.

387
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,440
You can leave tomorrow.

388
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,600
Hello. Are you up?
I'm in Thailand, honey.

389
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,080
Where did you go? You didn't tell me.

390
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:24,280
What did you say? Isn't this Muenfah?

391
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,600
Hello? Can you hear me?

392
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,240
Hello.

393
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,120
It's the right number, isn't it?

394
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,960
How comes it's not Fah answering.

395
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,160
Excuse me? Can you hear me?

396
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,220
Hello.

397
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,160
Yes, Mom.

398
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,160
Oh, who are you with?

399
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,800
- I'm with Teerak.
- Are you?

400
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,040
Are you in Thailand now?

401
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,880
Punlee said he'd pick you guys up.
Have you guys met?

402
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,520
Not yet. I'm calling him.

403
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,880
Okay. Goodbye, Mom.

404
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,160
Are you shy?

405
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,120
It was embarrassing.

406
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,960
It wasn't.

407
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,000
You were really adorable.

408
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,560
Come on!

409
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,640
My mom won't be mad.

410
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,120
What if something happened to you?

411
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,360
I was worried about you!

412
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,000
- Stop playing with my feelings!
- I'm not!

413
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,200
It's my fault.

414
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,960
Real...

415
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:39,120
[I'm leaving]

416
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:01,360
[I'm leaving]

417
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,360
You think I look good today?

418
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,960
You're adorable.

419
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,680
Don't worry.

420
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,640
My mom and dad will love you the way I do.

421
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,080
But I accidentally picked up her call
on your phone.

422
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,800
She won't be mad.

423
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,080
Trust me.

424
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,640
I'm going to the toilet.

425
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,680
Wait for me here, okay?

426
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,560
Dad, Mom.

427
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,920
This is Teerak, my boyfriend.

428
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,200
Hello.

429
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,640
Hello.

430
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,960
Who are your parents?

431
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,410
What do they do for a living?

432
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,080
My dad is a school director,

433
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,560
and my mom is...

434
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,800
a housewife.

435
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,000
At a public school or a private one?

436
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,480
A...

437
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:51,840
Uh...

438
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,720
A...

439
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,680
Hey!

440
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,600
You're stammering!
I can't make sense of it.

441
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,480
I'm sorry.

442
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,680
If you want to be with my son,

443
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,920
you have to be well-behaved.

444
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,680
Okay.

445
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,520
Not well-behaved!

446
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,920
You're not suitable for my son.

447
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,560
As his mom,

448
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:46,400
I warn you to stop dating my son immediately!

449
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,040
Thank you for everything you've done.

450
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:02,880
I apologize.

451
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,920
Can you give me...

452
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,400
Get out!

453
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,560
Leave!

454
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,720
Rak...

455
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,240
Shit.

456
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,160
Rak.

457
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,800
What's on your mind?

458
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,320
Uh... I'm scared.

459
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,600
We're lucky Type and Joy aren't here.

460
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,480
Otherwise, they'd make you even more worried.

461
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,720
Well...

462
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,200
I actually had a talk with them.

463
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,320
I knew it.

464
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,800
Trust me.

465
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,840
Why do you need me here?

466
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,130
Hello.

467
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,040
I am Teerak.

468
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,360
Hi, Naughty Baby.

469
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,400
Uh...

470
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,120
I'm not naughty. I'm a good boy.

471
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,640
I mean it.

472
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,720
Can you eat that?

473
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:51,200
Thank you, Auntie. I can.

474
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,640
Won't you call me "Mom" anymore?

475
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:03,800
I'm sorry for picking up your call
on Fah's phone, Auntie.

476
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,840
Aw, that's totally okay. I'm not mad,

477
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,320
but I'll be if you don't call me "Mom."

478
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,640
Okay, Mom.

479
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,840
Fah always talks about you.

480
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,040
Uh...

481
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,840
Is this going to be okay?

482
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:29,800
Mm.

483
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,840
Uh... What do you mean?

484
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,480
I mean... I'm a man.

485
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,840
Aw.

486
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,880
We never question

487
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,240
whether Muenfah is into men or women.

488
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:57,640
What matters to us is

489
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,040
the person he loves,

490
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,520
and if he loves them,

491
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,040
we'll love them too.

492
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,120
For me,

493
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,680
the only thing I wanna know is

494
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,360
if my son is happy or not.

495
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,240
However, you just made us realize that

496
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:29,760
our older son has been living his happiest life.

497
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,840
Thank you.

498
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:47,000
I think I'm the luckiest person in this world.

499
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,480
It's me; I am lucky

500
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,480
to have you as a boyfriend.

501
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,080
Aw, so sweet.

502
00:46:59,120 --> 00:46:59,920
Alright,

503
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,960
I think we should dig in now

504
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,760
- before the food gets cold.
- That's right.

505
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:06,960
- Give Teerak some food, too.
- Let's dig in.

506
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
- Eat up, okay?
- Yes.

507
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,720
- These are your favorite dishes.
- Let's get some rice first.

508
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,230
Fah told me.

509
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:16,270
I'm stuffed.

510
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:17,880
- Are you?
- Very.

511
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,040
We only have Chinese food
once in a while, right?

512
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,720
We'll see you later.

513
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,640
I'll bring Mom to see you often,

514
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:30,640
okay?

515
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,000
Okay. Get home safely, Dad.

516
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,880
Have a safe ride.

517
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,160
Goodbye.

518
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,040
Goodbye.

519
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:37,940
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

520
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:38,780
Goodbye.

521
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Have a good one.

522
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,840
Bye-bye.

523
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,360
Come on. Let's go.

524
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,400
Do you wanna have something more?

525
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,560
Uh...

526
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:50,750
- No? You're stuffed.
- Yes.

527
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,400
Are you okay, Teerak?

528
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,880
Why the long face?

529
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,880
I'm just worried that my parents...

530
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,440
won't be like yours.

531
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,200
I'll stay by your side,

532
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,640
hold your hands firmly,

533
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,480
and face this together with you.

534
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,120
[Teerak: I'm staying another night at Fah's]

535
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,240
[Teerak: I haven't finished my project]

536
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,600
[Babe: You're not coming home anymore, are you?]

537
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,840
[Babe: Mookrob misses you so bad]

538
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,880
[Teerak: I'll be there tomorrow]

539
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,560
What is it, Naughty Baby?

540
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:42,520
You have a tattoo?

541
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:53,800
"I'm your Sky,
and you're my Sea."

542
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,720
What does it mean?

543
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,120
It's us.

544
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,840
The sky and the sea

545
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,320
that finally meet.

546
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,640
Fah...

547
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,000
You're ready, right?

548
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:56,840
Morning.

549
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,280
What do you expect my lover to be like?

550
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,320
She must be a cute, lovely girl.

551
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,160
What about your art market idea?

552
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,400
- I got mine, already.
- I'll make art toys.

553
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,120
But I've not finished them yet.

554
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,520
Why are you here alone? Where's Real?

555
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,040
How come? You two haven't done fighting?

556
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,400
What about reconciling with him through a letter?

557
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:16,440
That must work very well!

558
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:17,680
Alright. I'll do it.

559
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:20,120
- "To Prarchana Phanha"
- What the heck are you doing?

560
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,880
I'm not in your life anymore,
what else do you need?

561
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,680
But we can be friends for now.

562
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:24,920
Can friends...

563
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,480
flirt with each other?
