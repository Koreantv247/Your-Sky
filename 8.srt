1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,530
I don't know...

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,510
what I'm currently feeling.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,600
Simply do what your heart says.

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:09,730
Bastard!

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,000
Fah!

6
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:15,930
I'm worried that he wouldn't like me

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,500
as he saw me snap when I was beating up Oh.

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,400
I think he's now afraid of me.

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,880
Huh? Don't tell me that you also love him.

10
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,680
If you're waiting for when you're ready,

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,620
when will that happen?

12
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,170
In the end, it might've been you
who was filled with regrets

13
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,930
for being too afraid to do anything.

14
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,930
If you don't risk it, then you won't know it.

15
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,370
How are you?

16
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:25,610
I'm so worried about you.

17
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,539
I'm sorry... for making you feel that way.

18
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,890
Well...

19
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,930
I apologize for disappearing for a few days

20
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,370
and not calling you at all.

21
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,960
Since I arrived,
I've had to run the hotel for my father.

22
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,150
I just finished my work.

23
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,520
Don't worry.

24
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:41,770
Well...

25
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,660
Is your father okay now?

26
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:45,680
He's all right.

27
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,050
He's totally fine now.

28
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,480
Are you tired?

29
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,800
Teerak,

30
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,340
I have something important to tell you

31
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,590
once I come back to Thailand.

32
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,300
What did you just say?

33
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,520
Umm...

34
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:32,970
Wait a sec.

35
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,200
Fah!

36
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,160
Oops! Are you on the phone?

37
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,800
I'll come back later, okay?

38
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,970
It's alright! We can talk later!

39
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,280
I'm leaving now.

40
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,200
Bye!

41
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,640
Is this the person you told me about?

42
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,540
Take him here to visit Dad and me.

43
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,200
Alright.

44
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,840
Hello, Saggy Cheeks.

45
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,079
How are you?

46
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,520
Nothing much.

47
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,000
Where have you been, Lee?

48
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,960
The hotel's busy right now.

49
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,790
Fah's literally running nonstop.

50
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,400
I've helped him, sometimes.
It's super busy.

51
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,120
Have you talked to him?

52
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:29,920
Yes, I have.

53
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,620
Fah told me that he had an important thing
to discuss with me.

54
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,200
Umm, that sounds good.

55
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,450
Why does your voice sound upsetting?

56
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,000
Lee...

57
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,970
Is it that...Fah knows how I feel about him now?

58
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,890
And he might come back here

59
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,370
to break up our fake relationship?

60
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,400
Huh?

61
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,760
How could you possibly think of that?

62
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,490
I would be fine with that.

63
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,650
I totally understand that.

64
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,200
I think we might have to break up
when he comes back.

65
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,890
Oh, Saggy Cheeks, you're making assumptions!

66
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:02,770
Listen.

67
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,340
The return flight is at noon.

68
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,640
- You...
- I'm going to bed now.

69
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,400
- Bye-bye!
- Wait!

70
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,440
Hey, Teerak!

71
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,440
Hello.

72
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,880
[Disclaimer: All depicted events are fictional

Viewer discretion is advised]

74
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,000
What happens? Are you sick?

75
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,850
No.

76
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,960
I couldn't sleep well last night.

77
00:05:57,409 --> 00:05:58,240
Well...

78
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,200
no one else is home now?

79
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,340
Yes...

80
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,800
They've been out to run errands this morning.

81
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,020
Rak.

82
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,280
Teerak.

83
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,140
Tee-rak!

84
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,040
What, Babe?

85
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,760
What were you spacing out about?

86
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,560
Looking at what?

87
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,360
Huh?

88
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,560
Don't tell me...

89
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,690
you haven't cleared it up yet.

90
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,280
Fah still has no clue
what you feel about him, right?

91
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,830
I'm afraid...

92
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,480
I'm afraid that...

93
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,760
If I say it, nothing will stay the same.

94
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,110
I don't know what he will feel
if I... say it.

95
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,900
Aren't you feeling uncomfortable?

96
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,580
If you keep being a scaredy-cat

97
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,540
and keep avoiding him like this,

98
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,120
each of you will never know
what the other truly feels.

99
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:11,960
As of now,

100
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,390
acting normal is already hard

101
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,630
for you, isn't it?

102
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,330
I told you

103
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,720
to say what's on your mind.

104
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,890
What should I do now?

105
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,360
I don't wanna feel uncomfortable like this anymore.

106
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,480
Rak, listen up.

107
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,760
No matter what the outcome is,

108
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,560
it's a chance for you to say
what your heart tells.

109
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,720
Am I right?

110
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,640
And no matter what happens,

111
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,060
I'm always by your side.

112
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,040
I don't want to see my little brother upset anymore,

113
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,080
you know.

114
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,960
Wait!

115
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,960
Isn't he coming back today?

116
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,560
- Yes.
- Hey! What are you waiting for? Go for it!

117
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,760
Go!

118
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,240
- Go, okay!
- Come on, get up now!

119
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,180
Teerak, the door's there!

120
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,480
I'm getting my bag.

121
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,800
Not now, leave now before it's late!

122
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,640
Now!

123
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,210
Hey, Saggy Cheeks!

124
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,520
Teerak.

125
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,700
Is this a surprise?

126
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,660
Well...

127
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,160
You two should talk. I'm leaving now.

128
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,030
I have some work to do.

129
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,920
Hold on.

130
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
What?

131
00:08:58,970 --> 00:08:59,970
Fine.

132
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,520
Talk nicely, okay?

133
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,330
I was about to call you, Teerak.

134
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,920
Fah.

135
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,760
I have something important to tell you.

136
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,490
I've been thinking for a while

137
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,700
about whether I should tell you this,

138
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,320
but if I don't,

139
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,040
I'll regret it forever.

140
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,920
I like you.

141
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,300
I don't know

142
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,240
exactly when

143
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,970
I caught this feeling for you.

144
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,170
But when I noticed it,

145
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,330
it's developed into liking.

146
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,360
I'm so sorry

147
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,280
if I make you feel uncomfortable...

148
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,720
- Teerak...
- Our fake relationship...

149
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,040
I think we should stop it right here.

150
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,200
Oh already stopped approaching me.

151
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,520
I won't bother you anymore.

152
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,160
Thank you for everything you've done for me.

153
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,000
Lee.

154
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,040
Hi, Fah.

155
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,280
Teerak ran away from me.

156
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,760
Do you know

157
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,000
where he often goes?

158
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,200
I don't know. I'll ask my friends for you.

159
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,120
Umm. Okay, thank you.

160
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,120
- Hello.
- Hey, Joy.

161
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,320
Do you know where Teerak is?

162
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,290
No. Anything happens?

163
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,240
Yes, Fah can't contact him.

164
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,240
I don't know where he is.

165
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,740
Oh, really?

166
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,720
What's wrong?

167
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,960
I'll ask Type for you.

168
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,640
Okay, please. Thanks.

169
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,680
Hi.

170
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,320
Hi, do you know

171
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,640
where Teerak is?

172
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,850
No.

173
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,480
Why don't you ask Babe?

174
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,170
You're right!

175
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,480
Okay, I'm calling Babe now.

176
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,200
Hello, Babe.

177
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,560
Teerak ran away from me.

178
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,420
Do you know where he often goes?

179
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,520
I... I already talked to him.

180
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,160
He's... upset

181
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
and stressed out.

182
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,960
Do you know where he could be at this point?

183
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,640
I know where he is.

184
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,400
Teerak…

185
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,480
Fah...

186
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,440
Sweetheart,

187
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,900
don't cry.

188
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,040
I'm fine with you...

189
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,600
ending this fake relationship.

190
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,520
Let's break up, alright?

191
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,950
Let's end the fake one

192
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,040
and build a real one together.

193
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,120
What do you mean?

194
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,200
Be my boyfriend, Teerak.

195
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,680
Fah...

196
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,000
It's nice to finally have some peace.

197
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,960
Recently, my business
has gone through lots of trouble.

198
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,200
Let go of it.

199
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,330
Let's look at it this way:

200
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,990
you just had bad luck.

201
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,520
It was almost going out of business.

202
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,040
But after the rumor ended,

203
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,360
my bar is getting back to normal.

204
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,560
That's good for you.

205
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,080
What about...

206
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,280
Fah... Isn't he here?

207
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,440
Oh, no.

208
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,560
He told me he had something important to do.

209
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,480
Well, by the way,

210
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,760
can you pay for my drinks?

211
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,720
What a weird rich person you are.

212
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,560
You always ask for free stuff.

213
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,400
Please... please!

214
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,080
Well, whatever you want.

215
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,160
Alright, I'll drink as much as I want.

216
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,320
Let's say...

217
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,960
this is how you repay me.

218
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,320
Sure.

219
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,320
Nice.

220
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,240
Well, Real,

221
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,040
you're my true best friend.

222
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,080
For tonight,

223
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,720
let's drink until we can't drink anymore!

224
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,520
Cheers!

225
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,120
Mmmm...

226
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,480
Pour me some.

227
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,880
Do it yourself.

228
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,320
Please...

229
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,330
Please do it for me.

230
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:16,960
Alright then!

231
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,520
I'll pour it for you.

232
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,600
Well...

233
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,640
I'll go breathe some fresh air first.

234
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,840
Are you shy?

235
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,770
I...

236
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,660
You like me back.

237
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:29,910
Yes, I do.

238
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,520
I was afraid to spill that word

239
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,160
because I thought you wouldn't like me.

240
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,000
I like you.

241
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,730
At first,

242
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,140
I didn't know how to act around you.

243
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:52,040
I didn't know what was on your mind.

244
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,690
So I was afraid to say it too.

245
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:58,470
Well...

246
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,140
What made you think I wouldn't like you?

247
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,500
That situation I had with Oh that day...

248
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,680
You were not afraid of me, right?

249
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,300
Why would I be?

250
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,660
That day when I fought with Oh...

251
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,600
I was a bit out of control.

252
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,720
I didn't dare to talk to you

253
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,040
because I wasn't sure if you'd feel okay with me.

254
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,200
I was scared.

255
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,960
I was scared to see you get hurt
when you fight.

256
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,170
I promise you, I'll do better.

257
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,800
You were the one telling me

258
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
to forgive ourselves as we forgive others.

259
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,040
Let's improve ourselves together.

260
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,920
Okay.

261
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,160
Thank you for understanding me.

262
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,880
You know why I brought you up here?

263
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,800
I have something for you as well.

264
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,280
Actually...

265
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,350
I've been liking you for some time.

266
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,440
For a while now?

267
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,600
You also like drawing?

268
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,800
- Umm.
- I love drawing.

269
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,360
I always take visual notes

270
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,800
as they help me remember them better.

271
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,280
I haven't noticed that.

272
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,280
It's really been a while.

273
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,730
Actually...

274
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,360
I had liked you way before that.

275
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,880
Really?

276
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,520
Whoever has no name tag, go meet the seniors.

277
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,840
For others,
send out one representative to perform.

278
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,920
- Fah, isn't that your brother?
- You look fine.

279
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,500
Pick one more friend.

280
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,760
Teerak, come on.

281
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,840
Teerak, come forward.
[Welcome, all Digital Media freshmen]

"Saggy Cheeks."

283
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,120
What a cute nickname!

284
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,000
Drum roll, please.

285
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,160
♫Burned chicken, burned chicken♫

289
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,680
Thank you.

290
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,240
Sorry, can you give me the ball?

291
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:09,880
Hey!

292
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,240
I'm sorry.

293
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,520
Ouch!

294
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,440
I'm sorry.

295
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,920
Don't you think Punlee
and his friends were acting a bit weird?

296
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:15,870
I was interested in you.

297
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,040
The more I got to know you,
the more interested I became.

298
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,480
I started to develop feelings for you.

299
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,460
And from there,

300
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,220
it grew into liking you.

301
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,520
The more I know you,

302
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,640
the more I like you.

303
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,560
And it's even more than the fear in me.

304
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,210
So I decided to tell you how I feel.

305
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,880
Although the past relationship was all fake,

306
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,840
my feelings for you...

307
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,000
were completely true.

308
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,960
So that means...

309
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,240
Both of us are...

310
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,160
If you're okay with this,

311
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,850
let's change this pretend relationship

312
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,640
into a real one.

313
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,840
Sure. I am okay with it.

314
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,160
I said your hair stank,

315
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,750
but that was a lie.

316
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,360
Your hair smells the most amazing to me.

317
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,080
Fah!

318
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,680
I'm shy now.

319
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,560
You can talk to me about anything.

320
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,440
I wanna be your good boyfriend.

321
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,310
Tell me anything:
what you like and what you don't like.

322
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,320
Okay.

323
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,580
I also wanna be a good boyfriend to you.

324
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,920
Right now,

325
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,610
please let me have a real love lesson

326
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:58,650
from you, Teerak.

327
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,050
From now on,

328
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,520
let's learn that together.

329
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,160
May I...

330
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,840
Okay.

331
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,000
You're not ready for it, right?

332
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,800
I'm just excited.

333
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,840
It's alright.

334
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,680
I can wait.

335
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,960
Well...

336
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,750
I'd like to reserve you for myself.

337
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,090
I'll give you a ride home.

338
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,720
You're not mad at me, are you?

339
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Ouch...

340
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,200
Ouch...!

341
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,400
It hurt!!

342
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,240
You're freaking heavy.

343
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,360
Where am I now?

344
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,360
It's my room.

345
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,920
If you're awake,
take a shower and go to bed.

346
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,560
Whoa!

347
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,280
How many people have you
brought to this room?

348
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,320
Real...

349
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:44,739
I'm so happy you brought me here.

350
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,000
Real...

351
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,560
Real...

352
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,480
Real...

353
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,960
Don't play with me right now!

354
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,679
Go take a shower.

355
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,040
Shall we do it together?

356
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,320
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

357
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,360
- I'm taking your shirt off for you.
- Hey!

358
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,960
- Let's take a shower together.
- Stop.

359
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,520
I told you to stop!

360
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,840
Why? Your heart's fluttering?

361
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,360
How about this now?

362
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,000
What do you feel when I do this to you?

363
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,640
And I'm telling you,

364
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,960
I've never brought anyone else here

365
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,040
but you.

366
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,120
I'm leaving!

367
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,840
Teerak, are you done?

368
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,480
What happened?

369
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,800
Babe...

370
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,680
I have something important to talk to you.

371
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,170
I...

372
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,120
Fah and I...

373
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,040
We finally agreed to have
a real relationship.

374
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,200
I don't know when it happened...

375
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:55,110
but then I realized

376
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,080
I really liked him.

377
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:02,700
We've sorted things out yesterday.

378
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,680
Then Fah... asked me to be his real boyfriend.

379
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,630
So I...

380
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,440
I wanna tell you first.

381
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,260
Does it sound good to you, Babe?

382
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,400
Nope.

383
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,120
Babe...

384
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,520
Just kidding!

385
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,100
I'm okay with whatever makes you happy.

386
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,800
I love you the most!

387
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,400
I was worried so badly!

388
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,360
Thank you, sis.

389
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,120
Why? It's literally nothing.

390
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,160
And you can always ask for my advice,

391
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,120
you know that?

392
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,960
Seriously,

393
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,800
I figured it all out a while ago!

394
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,280
How could you?

395
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,760
I'm smart!

396
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:09,280
But I don't know
how to tell our parents and grandpa.

397
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,970
I'm afraid.

398
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,160
I'm afraid that...

399
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,340
they won't be okay with this.

400
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,240
Don't worry.

401
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,920
Wait for the right moment.

402
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,700
It takes time, I know.

403
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,340
But you can get through this.

404
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,360
I'll always be by your side.

405
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,680
Don't be afraid, okay?

406
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:34,840
Okay.

407
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,520
Don't overthink it, okay?

408
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:40,880
I heard you.

409
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,080
Let's go!

410
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,480
Go to class.

411
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,480
Let's go.

412
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,240
Your bag.

413
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,440
Go grab it!

414
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,040
- I'll wait downstairs.
- Okay.

415
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,560
Real.

416
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,080
- Huh?
- Why didn't Hia come with you?

417
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,800
I... I don't know.

418
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,800
And...

419
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,200
What?

420
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,160
I wanna tell you that...

421
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,520
I...

422
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,240
I'm seeing Teerak for real now.

423
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,360
What the heck?

424
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,920
You're saying it as if it was fake.

425
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,240
You're right.

426
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,960
Previously, we were pretending to date each other.

427
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,320
But now,

428
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,680
we agreed to break up...

429
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,520
Break up...?

430
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,520
What!

431
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,800
What did you say!?

432
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,200
What did you just say?

433
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,280
You broke up with Teerak?

434
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,920
Why? What did you do!?

435
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,160
Hia! Stop!

436
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,880
I didn't do anything.

437
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,720
Stop and have a seat.

438
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,680
Explain.

439
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,480
What I meant was

440
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,200
breaking our pretend relationship up.

441
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,240
Now, I'm dating him for real.

442
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,480
We're really dating.

443
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,920
Don't make a scene!

444
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,960
Listen to me first.

445
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:26,760
Okay.

446
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,080
I lied to you

447
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,000
because I wanted to protect Teerak from Oh.

448
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,280
So I had to lie to both of you.

449
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,480
You lied to me?

450
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,920
I totally believed it!

451
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,800
I didn't intend to do so.

452
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I know.

453
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,720
But I... will report this to Babe!

454
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,360
Here she comes.

455
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,800
- Babe.
- Huh?

456
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,120
Teerak and Fah was pretending
to see each other,

457
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,520
but they're really dating now.

458
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:02,840
You know that?

459
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,680
Of course, I do.

460
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:04,840
Why?

461
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,240
What!

462
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,800
I was the last one to learn this?

463
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,850
Oh, that's bad.

464
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,680
You evil!

465
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,400
Lover boy.

466
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,280
Hey,

467
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,680
there's no difference

468
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,920
between now and then.

469
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,000
Fah and Teerak have always been inseparable.

470
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,480
Umm.

471
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,280
Eh?! You have someone
you've always been with too!

472
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:33,920
Right here!

473
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,200
Yours is sitting right here.

474
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,840
I'm going to the bathroom.

475
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,200
Oh?

476
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,120
- What's wrong with him?
- I don't know.

477
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,480
Are you two fighting?

478
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,200
Nah.

479
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,400
Then why is he acting like that?

480
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,120
I... I don't know either.

481
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,440
You're acting weird.

482
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,360
Yes.

483
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,960
Oh, the class is finally over.

484
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,600
I was so sleepy.

485
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,880
Hey, Saggy Cheeks!

486
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,040
You almost bumped into him.

487
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,840
Sorry, I was having something on my mind.

488
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,480
What is it?

489
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,600
Are you feeling bad?

490
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,360
You've seemed spaced out
since the last class.

491
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:28,520
Yeah.

492
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,560
Are you worried about Muenfah?

493
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,720
What did he do to you?

494
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,640
Well,

495
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,680
what did you two talk about yesterday?

496
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,040
I don't want to butt in,

497
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,600
but I'm worried about you.

498
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,240
Fah and I...

499
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,320
Feel free to tell us that.

500
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,280
You can tell us everything.

501
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,120
Like...

502
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,360
Let him finish his sentence first?

503
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,720
You kept cutting him off.

504
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,720
I'm sorry!
I'm just so worried about him.

505
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,000
So what is it?

506
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,160
Tell us now.

507
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,080
Well...

508
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,320
Now, Fah and I...

509
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,360
are having a real relationship.

510
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,720
Oh, isn't that great?

511
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,080
Why are you making that face?

512
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,800
Oops, speak of the devil.

513
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,000
Your boyfriend is here.

514
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,040
We'll not bother you.

515
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,640
Muenfah, are you here to pick up your boyfriend?

516
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,400
Yes, I am.

517
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,360
Here you go.
Here's your boyfriend.

518
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,440
Here he is.

519
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,680
Thanks.

520
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:33,920
Bye-bye.

521
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:34,760
- Good luck.
- Oh?

522
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,400
I told Babe about us.

523
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:52,840
However...

524
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,140
I haven't told my parents
and my grandpa.

525
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,720
I don't know what they'd think of this.

526
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,640
I'm so sorry.

527
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,720
Why so?

528
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,160
If you're not ready,

529
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,190
it's okay; we'll eventually find a way to tell them.

530
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,760
You're not mad at me

531
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,240
for not telling my parents, right?

532
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,960
It's not that I'm gonna keep it forever.

533
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,360
Don't worry about me.

534
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,360
As I told you, we can talk about anything.

535
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:40,200
Thank you for understanding me.

536
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:43,320
I thought... you would be worried,

537
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,190
so I kept this from you.

538
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:48,570
Teerak, don't overthink.

539
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,200
I've been waiting for you.

540
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,520
Hey!

541
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,280
Oh, Punlee!

542
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,280
We meet again!

543
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,760
Yeah. What a coincidence.

544
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,160
Can I sit with you?

545
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,960
Sure, come here.

546
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,880
- Ghlaijai.
- What?

547
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,120
You like stars?

548
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:46,580
Ummm...

549
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:47,840
I do.

550
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,480
Yeah, but I like the moon the most.

551
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,240
Lee...

552
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:03,680
Lee!

553
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,240
What are you smiling about?

554
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,620
Oh, nothing.

555
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,690
I like the moon too.

556
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,550
My name is Sasin;

557
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,600
it also means the moon.

558
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:34,180
What does that book... say about the moon?

559
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:38,240
It says...

560
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,320
The moon is a symbol of impossibility,

561
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,600
being distant

562
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,760
and out of reach.

563
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,560
It's like a metaphor.

564
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,210
Do you agree with that?

565
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,120
Yes.

566
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,560
What about you?

567
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:04,130
I think... things change.

568
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,000
In the past, that statement could be true

569
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,360
'cause the moon is very distant from the Earth.

570
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,440
But who knows?

571
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,600
Humans can now walk on it.

572
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:24,320
Humans can make a long distance

573
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,360
way shorter.

574
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,720
Like this.

575
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,160
See?

576
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,600
We're close now.

577
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,160
I... I mean...

578
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,240
Anything can happen.

579
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,600
You...

580
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,880
You like visiting this cafe?

581
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:07,240
Yes,

582
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:08,760
I sometimes do

583
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,360
when I'm worried;

584
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,760
coming here kinda helps.

585
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:15,680
It's quiet,

586
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,840
nearby the river.

587
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,480
I can tell.

588
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,560
Are you feeling awkward

589
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:34,960
having me next to you, like this?

590
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,280
So I can come here more often, right?

591
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,120
Sure,

592
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,340
if you want to.

593
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:49,660
You'll come with me, right?

594
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:51,920
Yeah!

595
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:54,640
Thank you.

596
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,600
Ghlai, you wanna eat anything?

597
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,760
I'll order it for you.

598
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:02,760
[Diana, Goddess of the Moon]

599
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:29,960
Oh!

600
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,600
Are you taking a wrong turn?

601
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:33,670
This is not the road to my house.

602
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,040
No.

603
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,520
There's a place I wanna take you to.

604
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:38,960
I think...

605
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,560
that place will help you ease your worries.

606
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,160
Is this the place you said?

607
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,400
That's right.

608
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,320
Let's go release your stress!

609
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,040
I wanna try lots of games!

610
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,200
You can play as much as you want.

611
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,480
Don't say no, okay?

612
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,170
I wanna spoil my boyfriend for a day.

613
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,720
Are you tired?

614
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,160
Oh, yes.

615
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:18,600
But it was fun.

616
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,280
You're feeling better now?

617
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,750
Yes, I am.

618
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:26,520
I'm so happy.

619
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,400
Thank you!

620
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,120
Are you...

621
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,240
Oh...

622
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:34,800
You're hungry, aren't you?

623
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,040
Yes.

624
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:37,840
Well...

625
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:39,760
should we go grab some food?

626
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,080
Umm.

627
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,880
This meal is on me.

628
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,120
Umm...

629
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:46,720
Alright then.

630
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,240
But...

631
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:49,880
can I pick the restaurant?

632
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:52,960
Sure,

633
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,560
whatever you say.

634
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:56,520
Umm.

635
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,360
What do you want to eat?

636
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Should we go look for it there?

637
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,460
- There?
- Yes.

638
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:24,880
Fah,

639
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:27,520
why are we ending up eating this?

640
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,560
There's no payoff in doing all that for me.

641
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,100
Why did you say that?

642
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,000
The food is delicious,

643
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,560
plus there's a stunning view...

644
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:39,360
Oh...

645
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:40,840
Wanna eat?

646
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,040
I'll feed you.

647
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:43,800
Eat, eat?

648
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,680
Won't you feed me?

649
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,160
You're a grown man!

650
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:57,440
Eat by yourself.

651
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,640
Should we take a pic together?

652
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,520
Sure.

653
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:56,440
Ummm...

654
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,880
Are we sitting too far apart?

655
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,040
So this is our first pic together

656
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:19,840
as a couple.

657
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,840
I no longer wanna kiss the plushy.

658
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,480
I wanna kiss the holder, instead.

659
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:27,800
Don't tease me.

660
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,880
You're too cute,

661
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,720
how can I resist?

662
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,000
Okay, alright.

663
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,720
I'll let this plushy kiss you, okay?

664
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,080
Please wait for me!

665
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,520
Ta-da!

666
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,600
- Whose puppy is this?
- You like him?

667
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:33,640
Hey, buddy!

668
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,120
You want us to take care of him?

669
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,690
Dom, take him back.

670
00:59:36,730 --> 00:59:38,250
Fah, look at him.

671
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:40,290
I'm so happy every time I look at him.

672
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:43,080
Just by looking, I see.

673
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:45,800
I didn't think you would bring me here twice.

674
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:48,080
I like desserts the most!

675
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:50,120
I like everything my boyfriend likes.

676
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,360
Let's get to bed.

677
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,200
Are you ready for that?

678
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,070
You think I look good today?

679
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,400
Don't worry.

680
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,560
My mom and dad will love you the way I do.

681
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:03,920
Hello.

682
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,680
Who are your parents?

683
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:06,960
What do they do for a living?

684
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,400
Not well-behaved!

685
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:13,640
I warn you to stop dating my son immediately!

686
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,520
Thank you for everything you've done.
